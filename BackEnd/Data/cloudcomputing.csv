< $25/hr ",2017,"Being a developer, responsive testing comes as a part of the package, every time I develop a webpage. I have been relying over LambdaTest for responsive testing. They have a feature which allows me to capture full page screenshots of my webpages in scores of different devices. I could even capture web pages that are locally hosted. And now, they have come up with a browser that lets me not only capture screenshots but interact with my websites in 25+ different devices, in a side by side view. That allows me to test my website responsiveness on a bunch of devices in a live-interactive manner. I must admit I am highly impressed by the LT browser and I am a tough guy to impress.; We use LambdaTest across our development & testing team. Our developers always perform cross browser tests on their local pages across different browsers and their versions before sending them to the testers. The integrations with 3rd party tools make it more useful. It provides a full development environment that looks very close to the real thing.Before we started using LambdaTest, we're limited to the browsers and their versions that are available on our desktops and laptops. But now with LambdaTest, we are using Selenium grid of 2000+ browsers and their versions available on the platform.If you want a solution to replace testing infrastructure that is hard to main and look after, LambdaTest is the best solution according to us.; Have been using Lambdatest for around 1 year now, and could say that it’s a useful testing tool for our team. Offering great combinations of browsers and operating systems for you to test on and most importantly there are many types of additional logs that come with each test which helps in debugging.. Glad to see the integration with Travis CI due to which we could optimally use this tool with our CI CD pipelines directly. We were able to effectively run TestNG and Selenium tests using their documentation and as an added advantage their support team is quick and helpful.; The industry we function (e-commerce) has a broad category of audience. We need to make sure our website is accessible to everyone irrespective of the browser / operating system they use. Ofcourse, responsive web design check is a major bullet point over our testing checklist as well. As a B2C, it's crucial for us to stay ahead of the customers and we wanted a solution which could help us ensure our changes would work seamlessly when shipped to the Production. LambdaTest made a great fit here when considered the latest browsers on the product, ability to test local pages along with a complimentary access to LT browser which is an absolute delight for our developers and testers. It helps us save a considerable effort on responsive testing plus the native developer tools allow us to dig deep into any UI mismatch! Also As mentioned we could achieve wider test coverage in time by running multiple combinations of browsers in parallel with LambdaTest automation suite. Our director to purchase the subscription was due to their affordable pricing for the parallel tests and the communication from the support team!; Running tests serially can be a good option when your product is at an early stage. But as we scaled the product, we needed a tool to reduce test time execution and pace up our test cycles. LambdaTest simplified the Selenium testing experience for us with their cloud based platform which allowed us to execute our test cases in parallel on hundreds of browsers. We could easily automate the test cases, get the sessions recorded and share the test reports across the team for assessment using Asana integration. We even leverage the integration with CircleCI to run automated tests on LambdaTest through our pipeline. The CircleCI Orb is handy for testing our privately hosted application.It’s good to see now that using LambdaTest we could run multiple tests on multiple VM’s, saving us hours of testing time and maintenance cost of local infrastructure. Personally, one thing that LambdaTest does very well is continuing to provide tutorials for testing, so that we stay up to speed and are even able to learn new things.I definitely saw myself applying a lot of the new concepts that I learned from their blogs.; As technology advances, enterprises are switching from manual testing to Selenium Test Automation. But one area most enterprises are still struggling is with the scalability of running several tests in parallel. LambdaTest has been a boon for us when it comes to Selenium automation. With a Selenium Grid based on the cloud, we don't need to stress about setting up and maintaining infrastructure anymore. We can run hundreds of tests in parallel on 2000+ browsers and OS versions running on real machines. LambdaTest really helped us in reducing our web testing cost and at the same time scale it as and when required.To leverage on marketing campaigns, we needed to ensure all our deliverables render seamlessly on different mobile and desktop browsers our users use to view them from across the world. The geolocation testing functionality helped us set the location and test our website over various locations. At LambdaTest, we can now run geolocation testing to test our website across 40+ countries. The pricing plan is pretty simple and easy to grasp, with no hidden costs at all.; We needed a testing tool that was scalable enough to cover all the browsers and OS as per our clients requirement and at the same time integrate well into our workflow. Lambdatest provided us with the necessary features to meet our browser compatibility testing requirements. Without any hassle of configuring, installing or maintaining the virtual machines, we are able to launch local browser tests instantly. The best part is, Lambdatest also helps us run our Selenium based automated tests on its cloud infra - that too without burning a hole in our pocket. They offer extensive mobile and desktop browsers, thereby increasing our test coverage to maximum.; We serve a variety of clients across industries, thus we need to make sure our website is accessible from every desktop, mobile browser combination they use. Responsive web design is an integral part of our testing process. As a B2B, you want to make sure that your services are always a step ahead of your customers. And to achieve that, it's important to have a tool that keeps your code and web designing process in sync with the Production.LambdaTest's variety of browsers and local testing capabilities made it a perfect fit for our requirements. Additionally we got free access to LT Browser which is absolutely loved by our developers. We are now in a better position while tackling misbehaving websites with the help of it’s inbuilt dev tools. The best part is that LambdaTest offers an automated parallel testing that helped us achieve faster and wider test coverage over multiple browsers. Its affordable price and fast technical support made the purchase decision very easy for the team. And yes I absolutely love their support staff. They are truly available for 24*7.; While we develop our web applications, our top concern was to verify the unintentional changes to the application's visuals. We need to make sure that changing one component doesn't break the styling of another component. LambdaTest's Smart testing helped us to identify visual regression bugs for every new build. We could capture our website screenshots belonging to different environments i.e stage and production & upload them on the LambdaTest Visual Testing platform. We were able to discover visual deviations with pixel to pixel comparison by capturing screenshots, comparing them against the baseline image, and highlighting visual changes. The slider mode is very helpful to compare the visual discrepancies between the two images by toggling them. Overall, Smart testing helped us perform reliable visual testing at scale and eliminated the risk of delivering visual bugs."

Serverspace,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2019,"First of all I would like to thank Serverspace for this great platform! Out of other VPS services, this is my favorite, it offers me the flexibility to enhance my skills as a Full-Stack Developer as well as a server administrator. Well out of frustrations from other VPS services, since they have a lot of hassle to work on, this platform enabled me to easily pick my choice, add new memory capability just by a few clicks. I observed the great UI/UX of this platform, and I am planning to use this forever until this platform is still working.; I tried many cloud server providers like AWS, Azure, Google cloud and more but they didn't satisfy my needs but when I tried Serverspace I was shocked because of their server prices, for a startup that will be the best option, I saw that the price is low but the service is best as expensive, I am fully satisfied with this. I recommend Serverspace for startups once a time you see, a cybercriminal attacked my server in serverspace but... the company has reported me on time, so I saved my server from further attacks, Serverspace saved a lot of time and money.; What I like about this company is the many options offered to us customers since I'm a Windows/Linux User and most of my needs rely on multi-OS systems. That's why I run 4 servers with ServerSpace. Their Windows Machines are as good as you can imagine, they offer all the alternatives I need, and I also run servers with CentOS. With Serverspace, I can cover all my needs for my business, and the best part is I also have different options on the payment side. They only charge me for the current use and not a whole monthly amount in advance, and I can cancel any server I ordered at any second. Also, their support tickets get answered right away. It's pretty good. What I think they could do better is improve their automatic system detecting payments with Ever. Every time I pay with Ever, I have to send a support ticket with transaction ID and all info about the payment to add funds. I get a reply the same day, but I'd rather not have to notify it. I'm very happy with this service, and I'll; I tried six to seven cloud services before I settled with Serverspace. I am glad that I found it. All I need was a reliable, scalable, economical, and user-friendly server for my data crunching and web application. First, their pricing is way attractive. The bigger sites may start with some low teaser rates or even free credits, but their prices go up exponentially with more CPU and memory. Serverspace's pricing remains very reasonable. Granted they don't offer super big servers, I don't need them either. The other thing I like is that they charge significantly less when you turn off the server while other sites charge you the same. I like their simple offers; simple servers that let me build my own environments. The plethora of bells and whistles elsewhere turn me off. Their servers are generally reliable except they failed to turn on a couple of times. But they fixed it promptly and were responsive through the process. Their clean and intuitive web UI is helpful.; I work most of the time but I also trade forex to make some extra money. Since I am not always at home, I had to get an expert advisor for my trades and that was when I started looking for a reliable VPS service. I have been using Serverspace VPS for less than a year now and I can say it has been a peaceful experience in the sense that I never had to worry about shutting down of the server. It's very pocket-friendly and I like that I can pay daily as I use it. What I enjoy most is the option to shutdown a server without deleting or destroying it completely, that way I can restart the server when I need it and continue using it. Like I said, you only get charged for what you use. For a little fee, you also have the option to increase the size or speed of a VPS server if your work becomes bigger without having to get a new server. I can only hope to get more than 50 Mbps speed for the fixed plan as it takes more time to work when everything is so slow.; I have been using Serverspace for about 6 months now. System performance is good. I have never used a VPS before, so I need some help getting up and running. Support always answers back thru a support ticket, although you may have to wait up to 6 hours sometimes, the support is good. Their pricing has been great, and I plan to stay with the service.; Before I decided to use their servers to host our services, I checked out and tried many alternatives. Some time ago I found Serverspace at some offers comparer and I decided to give it a try and I'm really satisfied. There are no problems with servers which I met using servers from others. So at the moment, I think I will use Serverspace servers for my other projects and initiatives.; I like Serverspace! The relation between the purchase price and the performance is perfect. I like dealing with you because of the cheap prices and high performance. Also, the support team is fast, I always get my tickets resolved as fast as possible. The deployment of services is also fast. In general, I do have a good experience and would like to build a long-term relationship.; The uptime and the speed of the service are fantastic. The quality of support is second to none. Every time I need help, I get a very personalized answer and they always go the extra mile to solve my problem. I have tried many competitors in the past but none of them come close to the quality of service I am getting in Serverspace."

LambdaTest,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2017,"Being a developer, responsive testing comes as a part of the package, every time I develop a webpage. I have been relying over LambdaTest for responsive testing. They have a feature which allows me to capture full page screenshots of my webpages in scores of different devices. I could even capture web pages that are locally hosted. And now, they have come up with a browser that lets me not only capture screenshots but interact with my websites in 25+ different devices, in a side by side view. That allows me to test my website responsiveness on a bunch of devices in a live-interactive manner. I must admit I am highly impressed by the LT browser and I am a tough guy to impress.; We use LambdaTest across our development & testing team. Our developers always perform cross browser tests on their local pages across different browsers and their versions before sending them to the testers. The integrations with 3rd party tools make it more useful. It provides a full development environment that looks very close to the real thing.Before we started using LambdaTest, we're limited to the browsers and their versions that are available on our desktops and laptops. But now with LambdaTest, we are using Selenium grid of 2000+ browsers and their versions available on the platform.If you want a solution to replace testing infrastructure that is hard to main and look after, LambdaTest is the best solution according to us.; Have been using Lambdatest for around 1 year now, and could say that it’s a useful testing tool for our team. Offering great combinations of browsers and operating systems for you to test on and most importantly there are many types of additional logs that come with each test which helps in debugging.. Glad to see the integration with Travis CI due to which we could optimally use this tool with our CI CD pipelines directly. We were able to effectively run TestNG and Selenium tests using their documentation and as an added advantage their support team is quick and helpful.; The industry we function (e-commerce) has a broad category of audience. We need to make sure our website is accessible to everyone irrespective of the browser / operating system they use. Ofcourse, responsive web design check is a major bullet point over our testing checklist as well. As a B2C, it's crucial for us to stay ahead of the customers and we wanted a solution which could help us ensure our changes would work seamlessly when shipped to the Production. LambdaTest made a great fit here when considered the latest browsers on the product, ability to test local pages along with a complimentary access to LT browser which is an absolute delight for our developers and testers. It helps us save a considerable effort on responsive testing plus the native developer tools allow us to dig deep into any UI mismatch! Also As mentioned we could achieve wider test coverage in time by running multiple combinations of browsers in parallel with LambdaTest automation suite. Our director to purchase the subscription was due to their affordable pricing for the parallel tests and the communication from the support team!; Running tests serially can be a good option when your product is at an early stage. But as we scaled the product, we needed a tool to reduce test time execution and pace up our test cycles. LambdaTest simplified the Selenium testing experience for us with their cloud based platform which allowed us to execute our test cases in parallel on hundreds of browsers. We could easily automate the test cases, get the sessions recorded and share the test reports across the team for assessment using Asana integration. We even leverage the integration with CircleCI to run automated tests on LambdaTest through our pipeline. The CircleCI Orb is handy for testing our privately hosted application.It’s good to see now that using LambdaTest we could run multiple tests on multiple VM’s, saving us hours of testing time and maintenance cost of local infrastructure. Personally, one thing that LambdaTest does very well is continuing to provide tutorials for testing, so that we stay up to speed and are even able to learn new things.I definitely saw myself applying a lot of the new concepts that I learned from their blogs.; As technology advances, enterprises are switching from manual testing to Selenium Test Automation. But one area most enterprises are still struggling is with the scalability of running several tests in parallel. LambdaTest has been a boon for us when it comes to Selenium automation. With a Selenium Grid based on the cloud, we don't need to stress about setting up and maintaining infrastructure anymore. We can run hundreds of tests in parallel on 2000+ browsers and OS versions running on real machines. LambdaTest really helped us in reducing our web testing cost and at the same time scale it as and when required.To leverage on marketing campaigns, we needed to ensure all our deliverables render seamlessly on different mobile and desktop browsers our users use to view them from across the world. The geolocation testing functionality helped us set the location and test our website over various locations. At LambdaTest, we can now run geolocation testing to test our website across 40+ countries. The pricing plan is pretty simple and easy to grasp, with no hidden costs at all.; We needed a testing tool that was scalable enough to cover all the browsers and OS as per our clients requirement and at the same time integrate well into our workflow. Lambdatest provided us with the necessary features to meet our browser compatibility testing requirements. Without any hassle of configuring, installing or maintaining the virtual machines, we are able to launch local browser tests instantly. The best part is, Lambdatest also helps us run our Selenium based automated tests on its cloud infra - that too without burning a hole in our pocket. They offer extensive mobile and desktop browsers, thereby increasing our test coverage to maximum.; We serve a variety of clients across industries, thus we need to make sure our website is accessible from every desktop, mobile browser combination they use. Responsive web design is an integral part of our testing process. As a B2B, you want to make sure that your services are always a step ahead of your customers. And to achieve that, it's important to have a tool that keeps your code and web designing process in sync with the Production.LambdaTest's variety of browsers and local testing capabilities made it a perfect fit for our requirements. Additionally we got free access to LT Browser which is absolutely loved by our developers. We are now in a better position while tackling misbehaving websites with the help of it’s inbuilt dev tools. The best part is that LambdaTest offers an automated parallel testing that helped us achieve faster and wider test coverage over multiple browsers. Its affordable price and fast technical support made the purchase decision very easy for the team. And yes I absolutely love their support staff. They are truly available for 24*7.; While we develop our web applications, our top concern was to verify the unintentional changes to the application's visuals. We need to make sure that changing one component doesn't break the styling of another component. LambdaTest's Smart testing helped us to identify visual regression bugs for every new build. We could capture our website screenshots belonging to different environments i.e stage and production & upload them on the LambdaTest Visual Testing platform. We were able to discover visual deviations with pixel to pixel comparison by capturing screenshots, comparing them against the baseline image, and highlighting visual changes. The slider mode is very helpful to compare the visual discrepancies between the two images by toggling them. Overall, Smart testing helped us perform reliable visual testing at scale and eliminated the risk of delivering visual bugs."

I'm very happy with this service, and I'll; I tried six to seven cloud services before I settled with Serverspace. I am glad that I found it.

I like their simple offers; simple servers that let me build my own environments. The plethora of bells and whistles elsewhere turn me off. Their servers are generally reliable except they failed to turn on a couple of times. But they fixed it promptly and were responsive through the process.

So at the moment, I think I will use Serverspace servers for my other projects and initiatives.; I like Serverspace! The relation between the purchase price and the performance is perfect. I like dealing with you because of the cheap prices and high performance. Also, the support team is fast, I always get my tickets resolved as fast as possible. The deployment of services is also fast. In general, I do have a good experience and would like to build a long-term relationship.; The uptime and the speed of the service are fantastic.

LambdaTest,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2017,"Being a developer, responsive testing comes as a part of the package, every time I develop a webpage. I have been relying over LambdaTest for responsive testing. They have a feature which allows me to capture full page screenshots of my webpages in scores of different devices. I could even capture web pages that are locally hosted. And now, they have come up with a browser that lets me not only capture screenshots but interact with my websites in 25+ different devices, in a side by side view. That allows me to test my website responsiveness on a bunch of devices in a live-interactive manner. I must admit I am highly impressed by the LT browser and I am a tough guy to impress.; We use LambdaTest across our development & testing team. Our developers always perform cross browser tests on their local pages across different browsers and their versions before sending them to the testers. The integrations with 3rd party tools make it more useful. It provides a full development environment that looks very close to the real thing.Before we started using LambdaTest, we're limited to the browsers and their versions that are available on our desktops and laptops. But now with LambdaTest, we are using Selenium grid of 2000+ browsers and their versions available on the platform.If you want a solution to replace testing infrastructure that is hard to main and look after, LambdaTest is the best solution according to us.; Have been using Lambdatest for around 1 year now, and could say that it’s a useful testing tool for our team. Offering great combinations of browsers and operating systems for you to test on and most importantly there are many types of additional logs that come with each test which helps in debugging.. Glad to see the integration with Travis CI due to which we could optimally use this tool with our CI CD pipelines directly. We were able to effectively run TestNG and Selenium tests using their documentation and as an added advantage their support team is quick and helpful.; The industry we function (e-commerce) has a broad category of audience. We need to make sure our website is accessible to everyone irrespective of the browser / operating system they use. Ofcourse, responsive web design check is a major bullet point over our testing checklist as well. As a B2C, it's crucial for us to stay ahead of the customers and we wanted a solution which could help us ensure our changes would work seamlessly when shipped to the Production. LambdaTest made a great fit here when considered the latest browsers on the product, ability to test local pages along with a complimentary access to LT browser which is an absolute delight for our developers and testers. It helps us save a considerable effort on responsive testing plus the native developer tools allow us to dig deep into any UI mismatch! Also As mentioned we could achieve wider test coverage in time by running multiple combinations of browsers in parallel with LambdaTest automation suite. Our director to purchase the subscription was due to their affordable pricing for the parallel tests and the communication from the support team!; Running tests serially can be a good option when your product is at an early stage. But as we scaled the product, we needed a tool to reduce test time execution and pace up our test cycles. LambdaTest simplified the Selenium testing experience for us with their cloud based platform which allowed us to execute our test cases in parallel on hundreds of browsers. We could easily automate the test cases, get the sessions recorded and share the test reports across the team for assessment using Asana integration. We even leverage the integration with CircleCI to run automated tests on LambdaTest through our pipeline. The CircleCI Orb is handy for testing our privately hosted application.It’s good to see now that using LambdaTest we could run multiple tests on multiple VM’s, saving us hours of testing time and maintenance cost of local infrastructure. Personally, one thing that LambdaTest does very well is continuing to provide tutorials for testing, so that we stay up to speed and are even able to learn new things.I definitely saw myself applying a lot of the new concepts that I learned from their blogs.; As technology advances, enterprises are switching from manual testing to Selenium Test Automation. But one area most enterprises are still struggling is with the scalability of running several tests in parallel. LambdaTest has been a boon for us when it comes to Selenium automation. With a Selenium Grid based on the cloud, we don't need to stress about setting up and maintaining infrastructure anymore. We can run hundreds of tests in parallel on 2000+ browsers and OS versions running on real machines. LambdaTest really helped us in reducing our web testing cost and at the same time scale it as and when required.To leverage on marketing campaigns, we needed to ensure all our deliverables render seamlessly on different mobile and desktop browsers our users use to view them from across the world. The geolocation testing functionality helped us set the location and test our website over various locations. At LambdaTest, we can now run geolocation testing to test our website across 40+ countries. The pricing plan is pretty simple and easy to grasp, with no hidden costs at all.; We needed a testing tool that was scalable enough to cover all the browsers and OS as per our clients requirement and at the same time integrate well into our workflow. Lambdatest provided us with the necessary features to meet our browser compatibility testing requirements. Without any hassle of configuring, installing or maintaining the virtual machines, we are able to launch local browser tests instantly. The best part is, Lambdatest also helps us run our Selenium based automated tests on its cloud infra - that too without burning a hole in our pocket. They offer extensive mobile and desktop browsers, thereby increasing our test coverage to maximum.; We serve a variety of clients across industries, thus we need to make sure our website is accessible from every desktop, mobile browser combination they use. Responsive web design is an integral part of our testing process. As a B2B, you want to make sure that your services are always a step ahead of your customers. And to achieve that, it's important to have a tool that keeps your code and web designing process in sync with the Production.LambdaTest's variety of browsers and local testing capabilities made it a perfect fit for our requirements. Additionally we got free access to LT Browser which is absolutely loved by our developers. We are now in a better position while tackling misbehaving websites with the help of it’s inbuilt dev tools. The best part is that LambdaTest offers an automated parallel testing that helped us achieve faster and wider test coverage over multiple browsers. Its affordable price and fast technical support made the purchase decision very easy for the team. And yes I absolutely love their support staff. They are truly available for 24*7.; While we develop our web applications, our top concern was to verify the unintentional changes to the application's visuals. We need to make sure that changing one component doesn't break the styling of another component. LambdaTest's Smart testing helped us to identify visual regression bugs for every new build. We could capture our website screenshots belonging to different environments i.e stage and production & upload them on the LambdaTest Visual Testing platform. We were able to discover visual deviations with pixel to pixel comparison by capturing screenshots, comparing them against the baseline image, and highlighting visual changes. The slider mode is very helpful to compare the visual discrepancies between the two images by toggling them. Overall, Smart testing helped us perform reliable visual testing at scale and eliminated the risk of delivering visual bugs."
Serverspace,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2019,"First of all I would like to thank Serverspace for this great platform! Out of other VPS services, this is my favorite, it offers me the flexibility to enhance my skills as a Full-Stack Developer as well as a server administrator. Well out of frustrations from other VPS services, since they have a lot of hassle to work on, this platform enabled me to easily pick my choice, add new memory capability just by a few clicks. I observed the great UI/UX of this platform, and I am planning to use this forever until this platform is still working.; I tried many cloud server providers like AWS, Azure, Google cloud and more but they didn't satisfy my needs but when I tried Serverspace I was shocked because of their server prices, for a startup that will be the best option, I saw that the price is low but the service is best as expensive, I am fully satisfied with this. I recommend Serverspace for startups once a time you see, a cybercriminal attacked my server in serverspace but... the company has reported me on time, so I saved my server from further attacks, Serverspace saved a lot of time and money.; What I like about this company is the many options offered to us customers since I'm a Windows/Linux User and most of my needs rely on multi-OS systems. That's why I run 4 servers with ServerSpace. Their Windows Machines are as good as you can imagine, they offer all the alternatives I need, and I also run servers with CentOS. With Serverspace, I can cover all my needs for my business, and the best part is I also have different options on the payment side. They only charge me for the current use and not a whole monthly amount in advance, and I can cancel any server I ordered at any second. Also, their support tickets get answered right away. It's pretty good. What I think they could do better is improve their automatic system detecting payments with Ever. Every time I pay with Ever, I have to send a support ticket with transaction ID and all info about the payment to add funds. I get a reply the same day, but I'd rather not have to notify it. I'm very happy with this service, and I'll; I tried six to seven cloud services before I settled with Serverspace. I am glad that I found it. All I need was a reliable, scalable, economical, and user-friendly server for my data crunching and web application. First, their pricing is way attractive. The bigger sites may start with some low teaser rates or even free credits, but their prices go up exponentially with more CPU and memory. Serverspace's pricing remains very reasonable. Granted they don't offer super big servers, I don't need them either. The other thing I like is that they charge significantly less when you turn off the server while other sites charge you the same. I like their simple offers; simple servers that let me build my own environments. The plethora of bells and whistles elsewhere turn me off. Their servers are generally reliable except they failed to turn on a couple of times. But they fixed it promptly and were responsive through the process. Their clean and intuitive web UI is helpful.; I work most of the time but I also trade forex to make some extra money. Since I am not always at home, I had to get an expert advisor for my trades and that was when I started looking for a reliable VPS service. I have been using Serverspace VPS for less than a year now and I can say it has been a peaceful experience in the sense that I never had to worry about shutting down of the server. It's very pocket-friendly and I like that I can pay daily as I use it. What I enjoy most is the option to shutdown a server without deleting or destroying it completely, that way I can restart the server when I need it and continue using it. Like I said, you only get charged for what you use. For a little fee, you also have the option to increase the size or speed of a VPS server if your work becomes bigger without having to get a new server. I can only hope to get more than 50 Mbps speed for the fixed plan as it takes more time to work when everything is so slow.; I have been using Serverspace for about 6 months now. System performance is good. I have never used a VPS before, so I need some help getting up and running. Support always answers back thru a support ticket, although you may have to wait up to 6 hours sometimes, the support is good. Their pricing has been great, and I plan to stay with the service.; Before I decided to use their servers to host our services, I checked out and tried many alternatives. Some time ago I found Serverspace at some offers comparer and I decided to give it a try and I'm really satisfied. There are no problems with servers which I met using servers from others.

The geolocation testing functionality helped us set the location and test our website over various locations. At LambdaTest, we can now run geolocation testing to test our website across 40+ countries. The pricing plan is pretty simple and easy to grasp, with no hidden costs at all.; We needed a testing tool that was scalable enough to cover all the browsers and OS as per our clients requirement and at the same time integrate well into our workflow. Lambdatest provided us with the necessary features to meet our browser compatibility testing requirements. Without any hassle of configuring, installing or maintaining the virtual machines, we are able to launch local browser tests instantly.

We need to make sure that changing one component doesn't break the styling of another component. LambdaTest's Smart testing helped us to identify visual regression bugs for every new build. We could capture our website screenshots belonging to different environments i.e stage and production & upload them on the LambdaTest Visual Testing platform. We were able to discover visual deviations with pixel to pixel comparison by capturing screenshots, comparing them against the baseline image, and highlighting visual changes. The slider mode is very helpful to compare the visual discrepancies between the two images by toggling them. Overall, Smart testing helped us perform reliable visual testing at scale and eliminated the risk of delivering visual bugs."
Serverspace,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2019,"First of all I would like to thank Serverspace for this great platform! Out of other VPS services, this is my favorite, it offers me the flexibility to enhance my skills as a Full-Stack Developer as well as a server administrator. Well out of frustrations from other VPS services, since they have a lot of hassle to work on, this platform enabled me to easily pick my choice, add new memory capability just by a few clicks. I observed the great UI/UX of this platform, and I am planning to use this forever until this platform is still working.; I tried many cloud server providers like AWS, Azure, Google cloud and more but they didn't satisfy my needs but when I tried Serverspace I was shocked because of their server prices, for a startup that will be the best option, I saw that the price is low but the service is best as expensive, I am fully satisfied with this. I recommend Serverspace for startups once a time you see, a cybercriminal attacked my server in serverspace but... the company has reported me on time, so I saved my server from further attacks, Serverspace saved a lot of time and money.; What I like about this company is the many options offered to us customers since I'm a Windows/Linux User and most of my needs rely on multi-OS systems. That's why I run 4 servers with ServerSpace. Their Windows Machines are as good as you can imagine, they offer all the alternatives I need, and I also run servers with CentOS. With Serverspace, I can cover all my needs for my business, and the best part is I also have different options on the payment side. They only charge me for the current use and not a whole monthly amount in advance, and I can cancel any server I ordered at any second. Also, their support tickets get answered right away. It's pretty good. What I think they could do better is improve their automatic system detecting payments with Ever. Every time I pay with Ever, I have to send a support ticket with transaction ID and all info about the payment to add funds. I get a reply the same day, but I'd rather not have to notify it. I'm very happy with this service, and I'll; I tried six to seven cloud services before I settled with Serverspace. I am glad that I found it. All I need was a reliable, scalable, economical, and user-friendly server for my data crunching and web application. First, their pricing is way attractive. The bigger sites may start with some low teaser rates or even free credits, but their prices go up exponentially with more CPU and memory. Serverspace's pricing remains very reasonable. Granted they don't offer super big servers, I don't need them either. The other thing I like is that they charge significantly less when you turn off the server while other sites charge you the same. I like their simple offers; simple servers that let me build my own environments. The plethora of bells and whistles elsewhere turn me off. Their servers are generally reliable except they failed to turn on a couple of times. But they fixed it promptly and were responsive through the process. Their clean and intuitive web UI is helpful.; I work most of the time but I also trade forex to make some extra money. Since I am not always at home, I had to get an expert advisor for my trades and that was when I started looking for a reliable VPS service. I have been using Serverspace VPS for less than a year now and I can say it has been a peaceful experience in the sense that I never had to worry about shutting down of the server. It's very pocket-friendly and I like that I can pay daily as I use it. What I enjoy most is the option to shutdown a server without deleting or destroying it completely, that way I can restart the server when I need it and continue using it. Like I said, you only get charged for what you use. For a little fee, you also have the option to increase the size or speed of a VPS server if your work becomes bigger without having to get a new server. I can only hope to get more than 50 Mbps speed for the fixed plan as it takes more time to work when everything is so slow.; I have been using Serverspace for about 6 months now. System performance is good. I have never used a VPS before, so I need some help getting up and running. Support always answers back thru a support ticket, although you may have to wait up to 6 hours sometimes, the support is good. Their pricing has been great, and I plan to stay with the service.; Before I decided to use their servers to host our services, I checked out and tried many alternatives. Some time ago I found Serverspace at some offers comparer and I decided to give it a try and I'm really satisfied. There are no problems with servers which I met using servers from others. So at the moment, I think I will use Serverspace servers for my other projects and initiatives.; I like Serverspace! The relation between the purchase price and the performance is perfect. I like dealing with you because of the cheap prices and high performance. Also, the support team is fast, I always get my tickets resolved as fast as possible. The deployment of services is also fast. In general, I do have a good experience and would like to build a long-term relationship.; The uptime and the speed of the service are fantastic. The quality of support is second to none. Every time I need help, I get a very personalized answer and they always go the extra mile to solve my problem. I have tried many competitors in the past but none of them come close to the quality of service I am getting in Serverspace."

MetaDesign Solutions,cloud-computing-companies,"
 $50 - $99/hr ",2007,"We selected MetaDesign after evaluating several firms that each proposed a solution for our needs. MetaDesign worked with us throughout the process, providing recommendations on best practices, prototyping, development, and testing. They set up a cloud environment and provide a hosted solution including support on an ongoing basis. We had a team lead who worked with us directly and other developers as needed. We use the software on a daily basis in connection with our production process. It reliably performs exactly the function we need it to perform.Our team lead is responsive and available, reliably delivering work products on time. MetaDesign is responsive, they know what to do and they do what they say they are going to do!We are very satisfied with MetaDesign.; I have been working with MetaDesign Solutions for many years now and I can confidently say that this is one of the best companies that I've ever come across. The team is very professional and responsive, they work hard to understand the vision of their clients, and they provide excellent quality. They also help me design my app in a cost-effective manner. I highly recommend MetaDesign Solutions to anyone who needs an app or software development company; Have worked with Metadesign on multiple projects for more than 5 years now. They have a wide range of skills and keep themselves current with new technologies and approaches, so they have been able to meet our evolving needs for tech development. They have end-to-end capability and in a couple of cases they are the technology arm of my organization. They are very transparent in all their communications and interactions. So I have never been blindsighted by a key resource resigning for example. Would certainly recommend them to others; I highly recommend Amit and his team to anyone looking for a knowledgeable developer who is easy to work with and can quickly build a sophisticated scalable product. Throughout the development process, they became part of my team and were extremely proactive in tweaking and improving the product based on customer feedback. Furthermore, they always went out of their way to guide me on the best development practices to test, build and scale a product. It was a pleasure working with them and highly recommend them to everyone.; We decided to work with MetaDesign Solutions for our project as we found their offer appealing as well as affordable, especially considering our requirements.

LambdaTest,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2017,"Being a developer, responsive testing comes as a part of the package, every time I develop a webpage. I have been relying over LambdaTest for responsive testing. They have a feature which allows me to capture full page screenshots of my webpages in scores of different devices. I could even capture web pages that are locally hosted. And now, they have come up with a browser that lets me not only capture screenshots but interact with my websites in 25+ different devices, in a side by side view. That allows me to test my website responsiveness on a bunch of devices in a live-interactive manner. I must admit I am highly impressed by the LT browser and I am a tough guy to impress.; We use LambdaTest across our development & testing team. Our developers always perform cross browser tests on their local pages across different browsers and their versions before sending them to the testers. The integrations with 3rd party tools make it more useful. It provides a full development environment that looks very close to the real thing.Before we started using LambdaTest, we're limited to the browsers and their versions that are available on our desktops and laptops. But now with LambdaTest, we are using Selenium grid of 2000+ browsers and their versions available on the platform.If you want a solution to replace testing infrastructure that is hard to main and look after, LambdaTest is the best solution according to us.; Have been using Lambdatest for around 1 year now, and could say that it’s a useful testing tool for our team. Offering great combinations of browsers and operating systems for you to test on and most importantly there are many types of additional logs that come with each test which helps in debugging.. Glad to see the integration with Travis CI due to which we could optimally use this tool with our CI CD pipelines directly. We were able to effectively run TestNG and Selenium tests using their documentation and as an added advantage their support team is quick and helpful.; The industry we function (e-commerce) has a broad category of audience. We need to make sure our website is accessible to everyone irrespective of the browser / operating system they use. Ofcourse, responsive web design check is a major bullet point over our testing checklist as well. As a B2C, it's crucial for us to stay ahead of the customers and we wanted a solution which could help us ensure our changes would work seamlessly when shipped to the Production. LambdaTest made a great fit here when considered the latest browsers on the product, ability to test local pages along with a complimentary access to LT browser which is an absolute delight for our developers and testers. It helps us save a considerable effort on responsive testing plus the native developer tools allow us to dig deep into any UI mismatch! Also As mentioned we could achieve wider test coverage in time by running multiple combinations of browsers in parallel with LambdaTest automation suite. Our director to purchase the subscription was due to their affordable pricing for the parallel tests and the communication from the support team!; Running tests serially can be a good option when your product is at an early stage. But as we scaled the product, we needed a tool to reduce test time execution and pace up our test cycles. LambdaTest simplified the Selenium testing experience for us with their cloud based platform which allowed us to execute our test cases in parallel on hundreds of browsers. We could easily automate the test cases, get the sessions recorded and share the test reports across the team for assessment using Asana integration. We even leverage the integration with CircleCI to run automated tests on LambdaTest through our pipeline. The CircleCI Orb is handy for testing our privately hosted application.It’s good to see now that using LambdaTest we could run multiple tests on multiple VM’s, saving us hours of testing time and maintenance cost of local infrastructure. Personally, one thing that LambdaTest does very well is continuing to provide tutorials for testing, so that we stay up to speed and are even able to learn new things.I definitely saw myself applying a lot of the new concepts that I learned from their blogs.; As technology advances, enterprises are switching from manual testing to Selenium Test Automation. But one area most enterprises are still struggling is with the scalability of running several tests in parallel. LambdaTest has been a boon for us when it comes to Selenium automation. With a Selenium Grid based on the cloud, we don't need to stress about setting up and maintaining infrastructure anymore. We can run hundreds of tests in parallel on 2000+ browsers and OS versions running on real machines.

Codebay,cloud-computing-companies,"
$25 - $49/hr ",2014,"Once the first part of the project was released it was a considerable change, we eliminated manual records in the inventories and we managed to digitize our product information.And something that we did not consider, but had a positive impact, was sending everything to the cloud, when the pandemic hit we were forced to close the offices, so since everything was digital, the administrative functions, new orders, registrations and among others, were not seen affected.; There is constant communication, during the project there is a general review every three weeks; also, we had daily meetings to define activities, which allowed us to have a very quick response to any issue with the platform.Although the project was not without delays, these were minimal and were quickly corrected. The final project was delivered and implemented without major complications. Currently the Codebay team provides us with support and system updates.; We hire them for the development of a web application. A member of their team, Luis Sanchez was in charge of the project, we had several meetings to define the content and structure of the first sites. Later, he presented us graphic proposals and based on this, they began to develop. During development there were adjustments; Comparing them with the company I had worked with before, their communications are way superior. I always know exactly what they're working on, specifically the stage of the process where they're at. In addition, they're always upfront whenever things might take longer than expected. However, for the most part, they've completed things in a timely manner or even ahead of schedule.; We started working with a cloud specialist, who reviewed our current systems and implemented a work plan to migrate to the cloud. The process did not take that long, but we had complications migrating the information as our old servers were constantly crashing due to the workload. Eventually we managed to migrate everything, and from there Codebay has provided us with maintenance services.; We start by planning the different stages of development with the support of an architect and the design area. We already had a system made in .NET, so the new platform was programmed in the same language. The development had different variables which took a year to complete, currently we continue working with them with support and system improvements.; We have worked together for a few months and it has been a positive experience, the team besides being very committed to development, they have shown good technical skills. The management team has been aware of any issue and has been very open to follow up on doubts.; Codebay has served as the supporting development team for a startup incubation university.

LambdaTest,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2017,"Being a developer, responsive testing comes as a part of the package, every time I develop a webpage. I have been relying over LambdaTest for responsive testing. They have a feature which allows me to capture full page screenshots of my webpages in scores of different devices. I could even capture web pages that are locally hosted. And now, they have come up with a browser that lets me not only capture screenshots but interact with my websites in 25+ different devices, in a side by side view. That allows me to test my website responsiveness on a bunch of devices in a live-interactive manner. I must admit I am highly impressed by the LT browser and I am a tough guy to impress.; We use LambdaTest across our development & testing team. Our developers always perform cross browser tests on their local pages across different browsers and their versions before sending them to the testers. The integrations with 3rd party tools make it more useful. It provides a full development environment that looks very close to the real thing.Before we started using LambdaTest, we're limited to the browsers and their versions that are available on our desktops and laptops. But now with LambdaTest, we are using Selenium grid of 2000+ browsers and their versions available on the platform.If you want a solution to replace testing infrastructure that is hard to main and look after, LambdaTest is the best solution according to us.; Have been using Lambdatest for around 1 year now, and could say that it’s a useful testing tool for our team. Offering great combinations of browsers and operating systems for you to test on and most importantly there are many types of additional logs that come with each test which helps in debugging.. Glad to see the integration with Travis CI due to which we could optimally use this tool with our CI CD pipelines directly. We were able to effectively run TestNG and Selenium tests using their documentation and as an added advantage their support team is quick and helpful.; The industry we function (e-commerce) has a broad category of audience. We need to make sure our website is accessible to everyone irrespective of the browser / operating system they use. Ofcourse, responsive web design check is a major bullet point over our testing checklist as well. As a B2C, it's crucial for us to stay ahead of the customers and we wanted a solution which could help us ensure our changes would work seamlessly when shipped to the Production. LambdaTest made a great fit here when considered the latest browsers on the product, ability to test local pages along with a complimentary access to LT browser which is an absolute delight for our developers and testers. It helps us save a considerable effort on responsive testing plus the native developer tools allow us to dig deep into any UI mismatch! Also As mentioned we could achieve wider test coverage in time by running multiple combinations of browsers in parallel with LambdaTest automation suite. Our director to purchase the subscription was due to their affordable pricing for the parallel tests and the communication from the support team!; Running tests serially can be a good option when your product is at an early stage. But as we scaled the product, we needed a tool to reduce test time execution and pace up our test cycles. LambdaTest simplified the Selenium testing experience for us with their cloud based platform which allowed us to execute our test cases in parallel on hundreds of browsers. We could easily automate the test cases, get the sessions recorded and share the test reports across the team for assessment using Asana integration. We even leverage the integration with CircleCI to run automated tests on LambdaTest through our pipeline. The CircleCI Orb is handy for testing our privately hosted application.It’s good to see now that using LambdaTest we could run multiple tests on multiple VM’s, saving us hours of testing time and maintenance cost of local infrastructure. Personally, one thing that LambdaTest does very well is continuing to provide tutorials for testing, so that we stay up to speed and are even able to learn new things.I definitely saw myself applying a lot of the new concepts that I learned from their blogs.; As technology advances, enterprises are switching from manual testing to Selenium Test Automation. But one area most enterprises are still struggling is with the scalability of running several tests in parallel. LambdaTest has been a boon for us when it comes to Selenium automation. With a Selenium Grid based on the cloud, we don't need to stress about setting up and maintaining infrastructure anymore. We can run hundreds of tests in parallel on 2000+ browsers and OS versions running on real machines. LambdaTest really helped us in reducing our web testing cost and at the same time scale it as and when required.To leverage on marketing campaigns, we needed to ensure all our deliverables render seamlessly on different mobile and desktop browsers our users use to view them from across the world. The geolocation testing functionality helped us set the location and test our website over various locations. At LambdaTest, we can now run geolocation testing to test our website across 40+ countries. The pricing plan is pretty simple and easy to grasp, with no hidden costs at all.; We needed a testing tool that was scalable enough to cover all the browsers and OS as per our clients requirement and at the same time integrate well into our workflow. Lambdatest provided us with the necessary features to meet our browser compatibility testing requirements. Without any hassle of configuring, installing or maintaining the virtual machines, we are able to launch local browser tests instantly. The best part is, Lambdatest also helps us run our Selenium based automated tests on its cloud infra - that too without burning a hole in our pocket. They offer extensive mobile and desktop browsers, thereby increasing our test coverage to maximum.; We serve a variety of clients across industries, thus we need to make sure our website is accessible from every desktop, mobile browser combination they use. Responsive web design is an integral part of our testing process. As a B2B, you want to make sure that your services are always a step ahead of your customers. And to achieve that, it's important to have a tool that keeps your code and web designing process in sync with the Production.LambdaTest's variety of browsers and local testing capabilities made it a perfect fit for our requirements. Additionally we got free access to LT Browser which is absolutely loved by our developers. We are now in a better position while tackling misbehaving websites with the help of it’s inbuilt dev tools. The best part is that LambdaTest offers an automated parallel testing that helped us achieve faster and wider test coverage over multiple browsers. Its affordable price and fast technical support made the purchase decision very easy for the team. And yes I absolutely love their support staff. They are truly available for 24*7.; While we develop our web applications, our top concern was to verify the unintentional changes to the application's visuals. We need to make sure that changing one component doesn't break the styling of another component. LambdaTest's Smart testing helped us to identify visual regression bugs for every new build. We could capture our website screenshots belonging to different environments i.e stage and production & upload them on the LambdaTest Visual Testing platform. We were able to discover visual deviations with pixel to pixel comparison by capturing screenshots, comparing them against the baseline image, and highlighting visual changes. The slider mode is very helpful to compare the visual discrepancies between the two images by toggling them. Overall, Smart testing helped us perform reliable visual testing at scale and eliminated the risk of delivering visual bugs."
Serverspace,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2019,"First of all I would like to thank Serverspace for this great platform! Out of other VPS services, this is my favorite, it offers me the flexibility to enhance my skills as a Full-Stack Developer as well as a server administrator. Well out of frustrations from other VPS services, since they have a lot of hassle to work on, this platform enabled me to easily pick my choice, add new memory capability just by a few clicks. I observed the great UI/UX of this platform, and I am planning to use this forever until this platform is still working.; I tried many cloud server providers like AWS, Azure, Google cloud and more but they didn't satisfy my needs but when I tried Serverspace I was shocked because of their server prices, for a startup that will be the best option, I saw that the price is low but the service is best as expensive, I am fully satisfied with this. I recommend Serverspace for startups once a time you see, a cybercriminal attacked my server in serverspace but... the company has reported me on time, so I saved my server from further attacks, Serverspace saved a lot of time and money.; What I like about this company is the many options offered to us customers since I'm a Windows/Linux User and most of my needs rely on multi-OS systems. That's why I run 4 servers with ServerSpace. Their Windows Machines are as good as you can imagine, they offer all the alternatives I need, and I also run servers with CentOS. With Serverspace, I can cover all my needs for my business, and the best part is I also have different options on the payment side. They only charge me for the current use and not a whole monthly amount in advance, and I can cancel any server I ordered at any second. Also, their support tickets get answered right away. It's pretty good. What I think they could do better is improve their automatic system detecting payments with Ever. Every time I pay with Ever, I have to send a support ticket with transaction ID and all info about the payment to add funds. I get a reply the same day, but I'd rather not have to notify it. I'm very happy with this service, and I'll; I tried six to seven cloud services before I settled with Serverspace. I am glad that I found it. All I need was a reliable, scalable, economical, and user-friendly server for my data crunching and web application. First, their pricing is way attractive. The bigger sites may start with some low teaser rates or even free credits, but their prices go up exponentially with more CPU and memory. Serverspace's pricing remains very reasonable. Granted they don't offer super big servers, I don't need them either. The other thing I like is that they charge significantly less when you turn off the server while other sites charge you the same. I like their simple offers; simple servers that let me build my own environments. The plethora of bells and whistles elsewhere turn me off. Their servers are generally reliable except they failed to turn on a couple of times. But they fixed it promptly and were responsive through the process. Their clean and intuitive web UI is helpful.; I work most of the time but I also trade forex to make some extra money. Since I am not always at home, I had to get an expert advisor for my trades and that was when I started looking for a reliable VPS service. I have been using Serverspace VPS for less than a year now and I can say it has been a peaceful experience in the sense that I never had to worry about shutting down of the server. It's very pocket-friendly and I like that I can pay daily as I use it. What I enjoy most is the option to shutdown a server without deleting or destroying it completely, that way I can restart the server when I need it and continue using it. Like I said, you only get charged for what you use. For a little fee, you also have the option to increase the size or speed of a VPS server if your work becomes bigger without having to get a new server. I can only hope to get more than 50 Mbps speed for the fixed plan as it takes more time to work when everything is so slow.; I have been using Serverspace for about 6 months now. System performance is good. I have never used a VPS before, so I need some help getting up and running. Support always answers back thru a support ticket, although you may have to wait up to 6 hours sometimes, the support is good. Their pricing has been great, and I plan to stay with the service.; Before I decided to use their servers to host our services, I checked out and tried many alternatives. Some time ago I found Serverspace at some offers comparer and I decided to give it a try and I'm really satisfied. There are no problems with servers which I met using servers from others. So at the moment, I think I will use Serverspace servers for my other projects and initiatives.; I like Serverspace! The relation between the purchase price and the performance is perfect. I like dealing with you because of the cheap prices and high performance. Also, the support team is fast, I always get my tickets resolved as fast as possible. The deployment of services is also fast. In general, I do have a good experience and would like to build a long-term relationship.; The uptime and the speed of the service are fantastic. The quality of support is second to none. Every time I need help, I get a very personalized answer and they always go the extra mile to solve my problem. I have tried many competitors in the past but none of them come close to the quality of service I am getting in Serverspace."

We could capture our website screenshots belonging to different environments i.e stage and production & upload them on the LambdaTest Visual Testing platform.

Serverspace,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2019,"First of all I would like to thank Serverspace for this great platform! Out of other VPS services, this is my favorite, it offers me the flexibility to enhance my skills as a Full-Stack Developer as well as a server administrator. Well out of frustrations from other VPS services, since they have a lot of hassle to work on, this platform enabled me to easily pick my choice, add new memory capability just by a few clicks. I observed the great UI/UX of this platform, and I am planning to use this forever until this platform is still working.; I tried many cloud server providers like AWS, Azure, Google cloud and more but they didn't satisfy my needs but when I tried Serverspace I was shocked because of their server prices, for a startup that will be the best option, I saw that the price is low but the service is best as expensive, I am fully satisfied with this. I recommend Serverspace for startups once a time you see, a cybercriminal attacked my server in serverspace but... the company has reported me on time, so I saved my server from further attacks, Serverspace saved a lot of time and money.; What I like about this company is the many options offered to us customers since I'm a Windows/Linux User and most of my needs rely on multi-OS systems. That's why I run 4 servers with ServerSpace. Their Windows Machines are as good as you can imagine, they offer all the alternatives I need, and I also run servers with CentOS. With Serverspace, I can cover all my needs for my business, and the best part is I also have different options on the payment side. They only charge me for the current use and not a whole monthly amount in advance, and I can cancel any server I ordered at any second. Also, their support tickets get answered right away. It's pretty good. What I think they could do better is improve their automatic system detecting payments with Ever. Every time I pay with Ever, I have to send a support ticket with transaction ID and all info about the payment to add funds. I get a reply the same day, but I'd rather not have to notify it. I'm very happy with this service, and I'll; I tried six to seven cloud services before I settled with Serverspace. I am glad that I found it. All I need was a reliable, scalable, economical, and user-friendly server for my data crunching and web application. First, their pricing is way attractive. The bigger sites may start with some low teaser rates or even free credits, but their prices go up exponentially with more CPU and memory. Serverspace's pricing remains very reasonable. Granted they don't offer super big servers, I don't need them either. The other thing I like is that they charge significantly less when you turn off the server while other sites charge you the same. I like their simple offers; simple servers that let me build my own environments. The plethora of bells and whistles elsewhere turn me off. Their servers are generally reliable except they failed to turn on a couple of times. But they fixed it promptly and were responsive through the process. Their clean and intuitive web UI is helpful.; I work most of the time but I also trade forex to make some extra money. Since I am not always at home, I had to get an expert advisor for my trades and that was when I started looking for a reliable VPS service. I have been using Serverspace VPS for less than a year now and I can say it has been a peaceful experience in the sense that I never had to worry about shutting down of the server. It's very pocket-friendly and I like that I can pay daily as I use it. What I enjoy most is the option to shutdown a server without deleting or destroying it completely, that way I can restart the server when I need it and continue using it. Like I said, you only get charged for what you use. For a little fee, you also have the option to increase the size or speed of a VPS server if your work becomes bigger without having to get a new server. I can only hope to get more than 50 Mbps speed for the fixed plan as it takes more time to work when everything is so slow.; I have been using Serverspace for about 6 months now. System performance is good. I have never used a VPS before, so I need some help getting up and running. Support always answers back thru a support ticket, although you may have to wait up to 6 hours sometimes, the support is good. Their pricing has been great, and I plan to stay with the service.; Before I decided to use their servers to host our services, I checked out and tried many alternatives. Some time ago I found Serverspace at some offers comparer and I decided to give it a try and I'm really satisfied. There are no problems with servers which I met using servers from others. So at the moment, I think I will use Serverspace servers for my other projects and initiatives.; I like Serverspace! The relation between the purchase price and the performance is perfect. I like dealing with you because of the cheap prices and high performance. Also, the support team is fast, I always get my tickets resolved as fast as possible. The deployment of services is also fast. In general, I do have a good experience and would like to build a long-term relationship.; The uptime and the speed of the service are fantastic. The quality of support is second to none. Every time I need help, I get a very personalized answer and they always go the extra mile to solve my problem. I have tried many competitors in the past but none of them come close to the quality of service I am getting in Serverspace."

Out of other VPS services, this is my favorite, it offers me the flexibility to enhance my skills as a Full-Stack Developer as well as a server administrator. Well out of frustrations from other VPS services, since they have a lot of hassle to work on, this platform enabled me to easily pick my choice, add new memory capability just by a few clicks. I observed the great UI/UX of this platform, and I am planning to use this forever until this platform is still working.; I tried many cloud server providers like AWS, Azure, Google cloud and more but they didn't satisfy my needs but when I tried Serverspace I was shocked because of their server prices, for a startup that will be the best option, I saw that the price is low but the service is best as expensive, I am fully satisfied with this. I recommend Serverspace for startups once a time you see, a cybercriminal attacked my server in serverspace but... the company has reported me on time, so I saved my server from further attacks, Serverspace saved a lot of time and money.; What I like about this company is the many options offered to us customers since I'm a Windows/Linux User and most of my needs rely on multi-OS systems. That's why I run 4 servers with ServerSpace. Their Windows Machines are as good as you can imagine, they offer all the alternatives I need, and I also run servers with CentOS. With Serverspace, I can cover all my needs for my business, and the best part is I also have different options on the payment side. They only charge me for the current use and not a whole monthly amount in advance, and I can cancel any server I ordered at any second. Also, their support tickets get answered right away. It's pretty good. What I think they could do better is improve their automatic system detecting payments with Ever.

I'm very happy with this service, and I'll; I tried six to seven cloud services before I settled with Serverspace. I am glad that I found it. All I need was a reliable, scalable, economical, and user-friendly server for my data crunching and web application. First, their pricing is way attractive.

It's very pocket-friendly and I like that I can pay daily as I use it. What I enjoy most is the option to shutdown a server without deleting or destroying it completely, that way I can restart the server when I need it and continue using it. Like I said, you only get charged for what you use. For a little fee, you also have the option to increase the size or speed of a VPS server if your work becomes bigger without having to get a new server.

 $50 - $99/hr ",2007,"We selected MetaDesign after evaluating several firms that each proposed a solution for our needs. MetaDesign worked with us throughout the process, providing recommendations on best practices, prototyping, development, and testing. They set up a cloud environment and provide a hosted solution including support on an ongoing basis. We had a team lead who worked with us directly and other developers as needed. We use the software on a daily basis in connection with our production process. It reliably performs exactly the function we need it to perform.Our team lead is responsive and available, reliably delivering work products on time. MetaDesign is responsive, they know what to do and they do what they say they are going to do!We are very satisfied with MetaDesign.; I have been working with MetaDesign Solutions for many years now and I can confidently say that this is one of the best companies that I've ever come across. The team is very professional and responsive, they work hard to understand the vision of their clients, and they provide excellent quality. They also help me design my app in a cost-effective manner. I highly recommend MetaDesign Solutions to anyone who needs an app or software development company; Have worked with Metadesign on multiple projects for more than 5 years now. They have a wide range of skills and keep themselves current with new technologies and approaches, so they have been able to meet our evolving needs for tech development. They have end-to-end capability and in a couple of cases they are the technology arm of my organization. They are very transparent in all their communications and interactions. So I have never been blindsighted by a key resource resigning for example. Would certainly recommend them to others; I highly recommend Amit and his team to anyone looking for a knowledgeable developer who is easy to work with and can quickly build a sophisticated scalable product. Throughout the development process, they became part of my team and were extremely proactive in tweaking and improving the product based on customer feedback. Furthermore, they always went out of their way to guide me on the best development practices to test, build and scale a product.

The final project was delivered and implemented without major complications. Currently the Codebay team provides us with support and system updates.; We hire them for the development of a web application. A member of their team, Luis Sanchez was in charge of the project, we had several meetings to define the content and structure of the first sites. Later, he presented us graphic proposals and based on this, they began to develop. During development there were adjustments; Comparing them with the company I had worked with before, their communications are way superior. I always know exactly what they're working on, specifically the stage of the process where they're at. In addition, they're always upfront whenever things might take longer than expected. However, for the most part, they've completed things in a timely manner or even ahead of schedule.; We started working with a cloud specialist, who reviewed our current systems and implemented a work plan to migrate to the cloud. The process did not take that long, but we had complications migrating the information as our old servers were constantly crashing due to the workload. Eventually we managed to migrate everything, and from there Codebay has provided us with maintenance services.; We start by planning the different stages of development with the support of an architect and the design area. We already had a system made in .NET, so the new platform was programmed in the same language. The development had different variables which took a year to complete, currently we continue working with them with support and system improvements.; We have worked together for a few months and it has been a positive experience, the team besides being very committed to development, they have shown good technical skills. The management team has been aware of any issue and has been very open to follow up on doubts.; Codebay has served as the supporting development team for a startup incubation university.

< $25/hr ",2017,"Being a developer, responsive testing comes as a part of the package, every time I develop a webpage. I have been relying over LambdaTest for responsive testing. They have a feature which allows me to capture full page screenshots of my webpages in scores of different devices. I could even capture web pages that are locally hosted. And now, they have come up with a browser that lets me not only capture screenshots but interact with my websites in 25+ different devices, in a side by side view. That allows me to test my website responsiveness on a bunch of devices in a live-interactive manner. I must admit I am highly impressed by the LT browser and I am a tough guy to impress.; We use LambdaTest across our development & testing team. Our developers always perform cross browser tests on their local pages across different browsers and their versions before sending them to the testers. The integrations with 3rd party tools make it more useful. It provides a full development environment that looks very close to the real thing.Before we started using LambdaTest, we're limited to the browsers and their versions that are available on our desktops and laptops. But now with LambdaTest, we are using Selenium grid of 2000+ browsers and their versions available on the platform.If you want a solution to replace testing infrastructure that is hard to main and look after, LambdaTest is the best solution according to us.; Have been using Lambdatest for around 1 year now, and could say that it’s a useful testing tool for our team. Offering great combinations of browsers and operating systems for you to test on and most importantly there are many types of additional logs that come with each test which helps in debugging.. Glad to see the integration with Travis CI due to which we could optimally use this tool with our CI CD pipelines directly. We were able to effectively run TestNG and Selenium tests using their documentation and as an added advantage their support team is quick and helpful.; The industry we function (e-commerce) has a broad category of audience. We need to make sure our website is accessible to everyone irrespective of the browser / operating system they use. Ofcourse, responsive web design check is a major bullet point over our testing checklist as well. As a B2C, it's crucial for us to stay ahead of the customers and we wanted a solution which could help us ensure our changes would work seamlessly when shipped to the Production. LambdaTest made a great fit here when considered the latest browsers on the product, ability to test local pages along with a complimentary access to LT browser which is an absolute delight for our developers and testers. It helps us save a considerable effort on responsive testing plus the native developer tools allow us to dig deep into any UI mismatch! Also As mentioned we could achieve wider test coverage in time by running multiple combinations of browsers in parallel with LambdaTest automation suite. Our director to purchase the subscription was due to their affordable pricing for the parallel tests and the communication from the support team!; Running tests serially can be a good option when your product is at an early stage. But as we scaled the product, we needed a tool to reduce test time execution and pace up our test cycles. LambdaTest simplified the Selenium testing experience for us with their cloud based platform which allowed us to execute our test cases in parallel on hundreds of browsers. We could easily automate the test cases, get the sessions recorded and share the test reports across the team for assessment using Asana integration. We even leverage the integration with CircleCI to run automated tests on LambdaTest through our pipeline. The CircleCI Orb is handy for testing our privately hosted application.It’s good to see now that using LambdaTest we could run multiple tests on multiple VM’s, saving us hours of testing time and maintenance cost of local infrastructure. Personally, one thing that LambdaTest does very well is continuing to provide tutorials for testing, so that we stay up to speed and are even able to learn new things.I definitely saw myself applying a lot of the new concepts that I learned from their blogs.; As technology advances, enterprises are switching from manual testing to Selenium Test Automation. But one area most enterprises are still struggling is with the scalability of running several tests in parallel. LambdaTest has been a boon for us when it comes to Selenium automation. With a Selenium Grid based on the cloud, we don't need to stress about setting up and maintaining infrastructure anymore. We can run hundreds of tests in parallel on 2000+ browsers and OS versions running on real machines. LambdaTest really helped us in reducing our web testing cost and at the same time scale it as and when required.To leverage on marketing campaigns, we needed to ensure all our deliverables render seamlessly on different mobile and desktop browsers our users use to view them from across the world. The geolocation testing functionality helped us set the location and test our website over various locations. At LambdaTest, we can now run geolocation testing to test our website across 40+ countries. The pricing plan is pretty simple and easy to grasp, with no hidden costs at all.; We needed a testing tool that was scalable enough to cover all the browsers and OS as per our clients requirement and at the same time integrate well into our workflow. Lambdatest provided us with the necessary features to meet our browser compatibility testing requirements. Without any hassle of configuring, installing or maintaining the virtual machines, we are able to launch local browser tests instantly. The best part is, Lambdatest also helps us run our Selenium based automated tests on its cloud infra - that too without burning a hole in our pocket. They offer extensive mobile and desktop browsers, thereby increasing our test coverage to maximum.; We serve a variety of clients across industries, thus we need to make sure our website is accessible from every desktop, mobile browser combination they use. Responsive web design is an integral part of our testing process. As a B2B, you want to make sure that your services are always a step ahead of your customers.

Codebay,cloud-computing-companies,"
$25 - $49/hr ",2014,"Once the first part of the project was released it was a considerable change, we eliminated manual records in the inventories and we managed to digitize our product information.And something that we did not consider, but had a positive impact, was sending everything to the cloud, when the pandemic hit we were forced to close the offices, so since everything was digital, the administrative functions, new orders, registrations and among others, were not seen affected.; There is constant communication, during the project there is a general review every three weeks; also, we had daily meetings to define activities, which allowed us to have a very quick response to any issue with the platform.Although the project was not without delays, these were minimal and were quickly corrected. The final project was delivered and implemented without major complications. Currently the Codebay team provides us with support and system updates.; We hire them for the development of a web application. A member of their team, Luis Sanchez was in charge of the project, we had several meetings to define the content and structure of the first sites. Later, he presented us graphic proposals and based on this, they began to develop. During development there were adjustments; Comparing them with the company I had worked with before, their communications are way superior. I always know exactly what they're working on, specifically the stage of the process where they're at. In addition, they're always upfront whenever things might take longer than expected. However, for the most part, they've completed things in a timely manner or even ahead of schedule.; We started working with a cloud specialist, who reviewed our current systems and implemented a work plan to migrate to the cloud. The process did not take that long, but we had complications migrating the information as our old servers were constantly crashing due to the workload. Eventually we managed to migrate everything, and from there Codebay has provided us with maintenance services.; We start by planning the different stages of development with the support of an architect and the design area. We already had a system made in .NET, so the new platform was programmed in the same language. The development had different variables which took a year to complete, currently we continue working with them with support and system improvements.; We have worked together for a few months and it has been a positive experience, the team besides being very committed to development, they have shown good technical skills. The management team has been aware of any issue and has been very open to follow up on doubts.; Codebay has served as the supporting development team for a startup incubation university.

LambdaTest,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2017,"Being a developer, responsive testing comes as a part of the package, every time I develop a webpage. I have been relying over LambdaTest for responsive testing. They have a feature which allows me to capture full page screenshots of my webpages in scores of different devices. I could even capture web pages that are locally hosted. And now, they have come up with a browser that lets me not only capture screenshots but interact with my websites in 25+ different devices, in a side by side view. That allows me to test my website responsiveness on a bunch of devices in a live-interactive manner. I must admit I am highly impressed by the LT browser and I am a tough guy to impress.; We use LambdaTest across our development & testing team. Our developers always perform cross browser tests on their local pages across different browsers and their versions before sending them to the testers. The integrations with 3rd party tools make it more useful. It provides a full development environment that looks very close to the real thing.Before we started using LambdaTest, we're limited to the browsers and their versions that are available on our desktops and laptops. But now with LambdaTest, we are using Selenium grid of 2000+ browsers and their versions available on the platform.If you want a solution to replace testing infrastructure that is hard to main and look after, LambdaTest is the best solution according to us.; Have been using Lambdatest for around 1 year now, and could say that it’s a useful testing tool for our team. Offering great combinations of browsers and operating systems for you to test on and most importantly there are many types of additional logs that come with each test which helps in debugging.. Glad to see the integration with Travis CI due to which we could optimally use this tool with our CI CD pipelines directly. We were able to effectively run TestNG and Selenium tests using their documentation and as an added advantage their support team is quick and helpful.; The industry we function (e-commerce) has a broad category of audience. We need to make sure our website is accessible to everyone irrespective of the browser / operating system they use. Ofcourse, responsive web design check is a major bullet point over our testing checklist as well. As a B2C, it's crucial for us to stay ahead of the customers and we wanted a solution which could help us ensure our changes would work seamlessly when shipped to the Production. LambdaTest made a great fit here when considered the latest browsers on the product, ability to test local pages along with a complimentary access to LT browser which is an absolute delight for our developers and testers. It helps us save a considerable effort on responsive testing plus the native developer tools allow us to dig deep into any UI mismatch! Also As mentioned we could achieve wider test coverage in time by running multiple combinations of browsers in parallel with LambdaTest automation suite. Our director to purchase the subscription was due to their affordable pricing for the parallel tests and the communication from the support team!; Running tests serially can be a good option when your product is at an early stage. But as we scaled the product, we needed a tool to reduce test time execution and pace up our test cycles. LambdaTest simplified the Selenium testing experience for us with their cloud based platform which allowed us to execute our test cases in parallel on hundreds of browsers. We could easily automate the test cases, get the sessions recorded and share the test reports across the team for assessment using Asana integration. We even leverage the integration with CircleCI to run automated tests on LambdaTest through our pipeline. The CircleCI Orb is handy for testing our privately hosted application.It’s good to see now that using LambdaTest we could run multiple tests on multiple VM’s, saving us hours of testing time and maintenance cost of local infrastructure. Personally, one thing that LambdaTest does very well is continuing to provide tutorials for testing, so that we stay up to speed and are even able to learn new things.I definitely saw myself applying a lot of the new concepts that I learned from their blogs.; As technology advances, enterprises are switching from manual testing to Selenium Test Automation. But one area most enterprises are still struggling is with the scalability of running several tests in parallel. LambdaTest has been a boon for us when it comes to Selenium automation. With a Selenium Grid based on the cloud, we don't need to stress about setting up and maintaining infrastructure anymore. We can run hundreds of tests in parallel on 2000+ browsers and OS versions running on real machines. LambdaTest really helped us in reducing our web testing cost and at the same time scale it as and when required.To leverage on marketing campaigns, we needed to ensure all our deliverables render seamlessly on different mobile and desktop browsers our users use to view them from across the world. The geolocation testing functionality helped us set the location and test our website over various locations. At LambdaTest, we can now run geolocation testing to test our website across 40+ countries. The pricing plan is pretty simple and easy to grasp, with no hidden costs at all.; We needed a testing tool that was scalable enough to cover all the browsers and OS as per our clients requirement and at the same time integrate well into our workflow. Lambdatest provided us with the necessary features to meet our browser compatibility testing requirements. Without any hassle of configuring, installing or maintaining the virtual machines, we are able to launch local browser tests instantly. The best part is, Lambdatest also helps us run our Selenium based automated tests on its cloud infra - that too without burning a hole in our pocket. They offer extensive mobile and desktop browsers, thereby increasing our test coverage to maximum.; We serve a variety of clients across industries, thus we need to make sure our website is accessible from every desktop, mobile browser combination they use. Responsive web design is an integral part of our testing process. As a B2B, you want to make sure that your services are always a step ahead of your customers. And to achieve that, it's important to have a tool that keeps your code and web designing process in sync with the Production.LambdaTest's variety of browsers and local testing capabilities made it a perfect fit for our requirements. Additionally we got free access to LT Browser which is absolutely loved by our developers. We are now in a better position while tackling misbehaving websites with the help of it’s inbuilt dev tools. The best part is that LambdaTest offers an automated parallel testing that helped us achieve faster and wider test coverage over multiple browsers. Its affordable price and fast technical support made the purchase decision very easy for the team. And yes I absolutely love their support staff. They are truly available for 24*7.; While we develop our web applications, our top concern was to verify the unintentional changes to the application's visuals. We need to make sure that changing one component doesn't break the styling of another component. LambdaTest's Smart testing helped us to identify visual regression bugs for every new build. We could capture our website screenshots belonging to different environments i.e stage and production & upload them on the LambdaTest Visual Testing platform. We were able to discover visual deviations with pixel to pixel comparison by capturing screenshots, comparing them against the baseline image, and highlighting visual changes. The slider mode is very helpful to compare the visual discrepancies between the two images by toggling them. Overall, Smart testing helped us perform reliable visual testing at scale and eliminated the risk of delivering visual bugs."
Serverspace,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2019,"First of all I would like to thank Serverspace for this great platform! Out of other VPS services, this is my favorite, it offers me the flexibility to enhance my skills as a Full-Stack Developer as well as a server administrator. Well out of frustrations from other VPS services, since they have a lot of hassle to work on, this platform enabled me to easily pick my choice, add new memory capability just by a few clicks. I observed the great UI/UX of this platform, and I am planning to use this forever until this platform is still working.; I tried many cloud server providers like AWS, Azure, Google cloud and more but they didn't satisfy my needs but when I tried Serverspace I was shocked because of their server prices, for a startup that will be the best option, I saw that the price is low but the service is best as expensive, I am fully satisfied with this. I recommend Serverspace for startups once a time you see, a cybercriminal attacked my server in serverspace but... the company has reported me on time, so I saved my server from further attacks, Serverspace saved a lot of time and money.; What I like about this company is the many options offered to us customers since I'm a Windows/Linux User and most of my needs rely on multi-OS systems. That's why I run 4 servers with ServerSpace. Their Windows Machines are as good as you can imagine, they offer all the alternatives I need, and I also run servers with CentOS. With Serverspace, I can cover all my needs for my business, and the best part is I also have different options on the payment side. They only charge me for the current use and not a whole monthly amount in advance, and I can cancel any server I ordered at any second. Also, their support tickets get answered right away. It's pretty good. What I think they could do better is improve their automatic system detecting payments with Ever. Every time I pay with Ever, I have to send a support ticket with transaction ID and all info about the payment to add funds. I get a reply the same day, but I'd rather not have to notify it. I'm very happy with this service, and I'll; I tried six to seven cloud services before I settled with Serverspace. I am glad that I found it. All I need was a reliable, scalable, economical, and user-friendly server for my data crunching and web application. First, their pricing is way attractive. The bigger sites may start with some low teaser rates or even free credits, but their prices go up exponentially with more CPU and memory. Serverspace's pricing remains very reasonable. Granted they don't offer super big servers, I don't need them either. The other thing I like is that they charge significantly less when you turn off the server while other sites charge you the same. I like their simple offers; simple servers that let me build my own environments. The plethora of bells and whistles elsewhere turn me off. Their servers are generally reliable except they failed to turn on a couple of times. But they fixed it promptly and were responsive through the process. Their clean and intuitive web UI is helpful.; I work most of the time but I also trade forex to make some extra money. Since I am not always at home, I had to get an expert advisor for my trades and that was when I started looking for a reliable VPS service. I have been using Serverspace VPS for less than a year now and I can say it has been a peaceful experience in the sense that I never had to worry about shutting down of the server. It's very pocket-friendly and I like that I can pay daily as I use it. What I enjoy most is the option to shutdown a server without deleting or destroying it completely, that way I can restart the server when I need it and continue using it. Like I said, you only get charged for what you use. For a little fee, you also have the option to increase the size or speed of a VPS server if your work becomes bigger without having to get a new server. I can only hope to get more than 50 Mbps speed for the fixed plan as it takes more time to work when everything is so slow.; I have been using Serverspace for about 6 months now. System performance is good. I have never used a VPS before, so I need some help getting up and running. Support always answers back thru a support ticket, although you may have to wait up to 6 hours sometimes, the support is good. Their pricing has been great, and I plan to stay with the service.; Before I decided to use their servers to host our services, I checked out and tried many alternatives. Some time ago I found Serverspace at some offers comparer and I decided to give it a try and I'm really satisfied. There are no problems with servers which I met using servers from others. So at the moment, I think I will use Serverspace servers for my other projects and initiatives.; I like Serverspace! The relation between the purchase price and the performance is perfect. I like dealing with you because of the cheap prices and high performance. Also, the support team is fast, I always get my tickets resolved as fast as possible. The deployment of services is also fast. In general, I do have a good experience and would like to build a long-term relationship.; The uptime and the speed of the service are fantastic. The quality of support is second to none. Every time I need help, I get a very personalized answer and they always go the extra mile to solve my problem. I have tried many competitors in the past but none of them come close to the quality of service I am getting in Serverspace."

They have a feature which allows me to capture full page screenshots of my webpages in scores of different devices. I could even capture web pages that are locally hosted. And now, they have come up with a browser that lets me not only capture screenshots but interact with my websites in 25+ different devices, in a side by side view. That allows me to test my website responsiveness on a bunch of devices in a live-interactive manner. I must admit I am highly impressed by the LT browser and I am a tough guy to impress.; We use LambdaTest across our development & testing team. Our developers always perform cross browser tests on their local pages across different browsers and their versions before sending them to the testers. The integrations with 3rd party tools make it more useful. It provides a full development environment that looks very close to the real thing.Before we started using LambdaTest, we're limited to the browsers and their versions that are available on our desktops and laptops. But now with LambdaTest, we are using Selenium grid of 2000+ browsers and their versions available on the platform.If you want a solution to replace testing infrastructure that is hard to main and look after, LambdaTest is the best solution according to us.; Have been using Lambdatest for around 1 year now, and could say that it’s a useful testing tool for our team. Offering great combinations of browsers and operating systems for you to test on and most importantly there are many types of additional logs that come with each test which helps in debugging.. Glad to see the integration with Travis CI due to which we could optimally use this tool with our CI CD pipelines directly. We were able to effectively run TestNG and Selenium tests using their documentation and as an added advantage their support team is quick and helpful.; The industry we function (e-commerce) has a broad category of audience. We need to make sure our website is accessible to everyone irrespective of the browser / operating system they use. Ofcourse, responsive web design check is a major bullet point over our testing checklist as well. As a B2C, it's crucial for us to stay ahead of the customers and we wanted a solution which could help us ensure our changes would work seamlessly when shipped to the Production. LambdaTest made a great fit here when considered the latest browsers on the product, ability to test local pages along with a complimentary access to LT browser which is an absolute delight for our developers and testers. It helps us save a considerable effort on responsive testing plus the native developer tools allow us to dig deep into any UI mismatch! Also As mentioned we could achieve wider test coverage in time by running multiple combinations of browsers in parallel with LambdaTest automation suite. Our director to purchase the subscription was due to their affordable pricing for the parallel tests and the communication from the support team!; Running tests serially can be a good option when your product is at an early stage. But as we scaled the product, we needed a tool to reduce test time execution and pace up our test cycles. LambdaTest simplified the Selenium testing experience for us with their cloud based platform which allowed us to execute our test cases in parallel on hundreds of browsers. We could easily automate the test cases, get the sessions recorded and share the test reports across the team for assessment using Asana integration. We even leverage the integration with CircleCI to run automated tests on LambdaTest through our pipeline. The CircleCI Orb is handy for testing our privately hosted application.It’s good to see now that using LambdaTest we could run multiple tests on multiple VM’s, saving us hours of testing time and maintenance cost of local infrastructure. Personally, one thing that LambdaTest does very well is continuing to provide tutorials for testing, so that we stay up to speed and are even able to learn new things.I definitely saw myself applying a lot of the new concepts that I learned from their blogs.; As technology advances, enterprises are switching from manual testing to Selenium Test Automation. But one area most enterprises are still struggling is with the scalability of running several tests in parallel. LambdaTest has been a boon for us when it comes to Selenium automation. With a Selenium Grid based on the cloud, we don't need to stress about setting up and maintaining infrastructure anymore. We can run hundreds of tests in parallel on 2000+ browsers and OS versions running on real machines. LambdaTest really helped us in reducing our web testing cost and at the same time scale it as and when required.To leverage on marketing campaigns, we needed to ensure all our deliverables render seamlessly on different mobile and desktop browsers our users use to view them from across the world. The geolocation testing functionality helped us set the location and test our website over various locations. At LambdaTest, we can now run geolocation testing to test our website across 40+ countries. The pricing plan is pretty simple and easy to grasp, with no hidden costs at all.; We needed a testing tool that was scalable enough to cover all the browsers and OS as per our clients requirement and at the same time integrate well into our workflow. Lambdatest provided us with the necessary features to meet our browser compatibility testing requirements. Without any hassle of configuring, installing or maintaining the virtual machines, we are able to launch local browser tests instantly. The best part is, Lambdatest also helps us run our Selenium based automated tests on its cloud infra - that too without burning a hole in our pocket. They offer extensive mobile and desktop browsers, thereby increasing our test coverage to maximum.; We serve a variety of clients across industries, thus we need to make sure our website is accessible from every desktop, mobile browser combination they use. Responsive web design is an integral part of our testing process. As a B2B, you want to make sure that your services are always a step ahead of your customers. And to achieve that, it's important to have a tool that keeps your code and web designing process in sync with the Production.LambdaTest's variety of browsers and local testing capabilities made it a perfect fit for our requirements. Additionally we got free access to LT Browser which is absolutely loved by our developers. We are now in a better position while tackling misbehaving websites with the help of it’s inbuilt dev tools. The best part is that LambdaTest offers an automated parallel testing that helped us achieve faster and wider test coverage over multiple browsers. Its affordable price and fast technical support made the purchase decision very easy for the team. And yes I absolutely love their support staff. They are truly available for 24*7.; While we develop our web applications, our top concern was to verify the unintentional changes to the application's visuals. We need to make sure that changing one component doesn't break the styling of another component. LambdaTest's Smart testing helped us to identify visual regression bugs for every new build. We could capture our website screenshots belonging to different environments i.e stage and production & upload them on the LambdaTest Visual Testing platform. We were able to discover visual deviations with pixel to pixel comparison by capturing screenshots, comparing them against the baseline image, and highlighting visual changes. The slider mode is very helpful to compare the visual discrepancies between the two images by toggling them. Overall, Smart testing helped us perform reliable visual testing at scale and eliminated the risk of delivering visual bugs."
Serverspace,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2019,"First of all I would like to thank Serverspace for this great platform! Out of other VPS services, this is my favorite, it offers me the flexibility to enhance my skills as a Full-Stack Developer as well as a server administrator. Well out of frustrations from other VPS services, since they have a lot of hassle to work on, this platform enabled me to easily pick my choice, add new memory capability just by a few clicks. I observed the great UI/UX of this platform, and I am planning to use this forever until this platform is still working.; I tried many cloud server providers like AWS, Azure, Google cloud and more but they didn't satisfy my needs but when I tried Serverspace I was shocked because of their server prices, for a startup that will be the best option, I saw that the price is low but the service is best as expensive, I am fully satisfied with this. I recommend Serverspace for startups once a time you see, a cybercriminal attacked my server in serverspace but... the company has reported me on time, so I saved my server from further attacks, Serverspace saved a lot of time and money.; What I like about this company is the many options offered to us customers since I'm a Windows/Linux User and most of my needs rely on multi-OS systems. That's why I run 4 servers with ServerSpace. Their Windows Machines are as good as you can imagine, they offer all the alternatives I need, and I also run servers with CentOS. With Serverspace, I can cover all my needs for my business, and the best part is I also have different options on the payment side. They only charge me for the current use and not a whole monthly amount in advance, and I can cancel any server I ordered at any second. Also, their support tickets get answered right away. It's pretty good. What I think they could do better is improve their automatic system detecting payments with Ever. Every time I pay with Ever, I have to send a support ticket with transaction ID and all info about the payment to add funds. I get a reply the same day, but I'd rather not have to notify it. I'm very happy with this service, and I'll; I tried six to seven cloud services before I settled with Serverspace. I am glad that I found it. All I need was a reliable, scalable, economical, and user-friendly server for my data crunching and web application. First, their pricing is way attractive. The bigger sites may start with some low teaser rates or even free credits, but their prices go up exponentially with more CPU and memory. Serverspace's pricing remains very reasonable. Granted they don't offer super big servers, I don't need them either. The other thing I like is that they charge significantly less when you turn off the server while other sites charge you the same. I like their simple offers; simple servers that let me build my own environments. The plethora of bells and whistles elsewhere turn me off. Their servers are generally reliable except they failed to turn on a couple of times. But they fixed it promptly and were responsive through the process. Their clean and intuitive web UI is helpful.; I work most of the time but I also trade forex to make some extra money. Since I am not always at home, I had to get an expert advisor for my trades and that was when I started looking for a reliable VPS service. I have been using Serverspace VPS for less than a year now and I can say it has been a peaceful experience in the sense that I never had to worry about shutting down of the server. It's very pocket-friendly and I like that I can pay daily as I use it. What I enjoy most is the option to shutdown a server without deleting or destroying it completely, that way I can restart the server when I need it and continue using it. Like I said, you only get charged for what you use. For a little fee, you also have the option to increase the size or speed of a VPS server if your work becomes bigger without having to get a new server. I can only hope to get more than 50 Mbps speed for the fixed plan as it takes more time to work when everything is so slow.; I have been using Serverspace for about 6 months now. System performance is good. I have never used a VPS before, so I need some help getting up and running. Support always answers back thru a support ticket, although you may have to wait up to 6 hours sometimes, the support is good. Their pricing has been great, and I plan to stay with the service.; Before I decided to use their servers to host our services, I checked out and tried many alternatives. Some time ago I found Serverspace at some offers comparer and I decided to give it a try and I'm really satisfied. There are no problems with servers which I met using servers from others. So at the moment, I think I will use Serverspace servers for my other projects and initiatives.; I like Serverspace! The relation between the purchase price and the performance is perfect. I like dealing with you because of the cheap prices and high performance. Also, the support team is fast, I always get my tickets resolved as fast as possible. The deployment of services is also fast. In general, I do have a good experience and would like to build a long-term relationship.; The uptime and the speed of the service are fantastic. The quality of support is second to none. Every time I need help, I get a very personalized answer and they always go the extra mile to solve my problem. I have tried many competitors in the past but none of them come close to the quality of service I am getting in Serverspace."

< $25/hr ",2019,"First of all I would like to thank Serverspace for this great platform! Out of other VPS services, this is my favorite, it offers me the flexibility to enhance my skills as a Full-Stack Developer as well as a server administrator. Well out of frustrations from other VPS services, since they have a lot of hassle to work on, this platform enabled me to easily pick my choice, add new memory capability just by a few clicks. I observed the great UI/UX of this platform, and I am planning to use this forever until this platform is still working.; I tried many cloud server providers like AWS, Azure, Google cloud and more but they didn't satisfy my needs but when I tried Serverspace I was shocked because of their server prices, for a startup that will be the best option, I saw that the price is low but the service is best as expensive, I am fully satisfied with this. I recommend Serverspace for startups once a time you see, a cybercriminal attacked my server in serverspace but... the company has reported me on time, so I saved my server from further attacks, Serverspace saved a lot of time and money.; What I like about this company is the many options offered to us customers since I'm a Windows/Linux User and most of my needs rely on multi-OS systems. That's why I run 4 servers with ServerSpace. Their Windows Machines are as good as you can imagine, they offer all the alternatives I need, and I also run servers with CentOS. With Serverspace, I can cover all my needs for my business, and the best part is I also have different options on the payment side. They only charge me for the current use and not a whole monthly amount in advance, and I can cancel any server I ordered at any second. Also, their support tickets get answered right away. It's pretty good. What I think they could do better is improve their automatic system detecting payments with Ever. Every time I pay with Ever, I have to send a support ticket with transaction ID and all info about the payment to add funds. I get a reply the same day, but I'd rather not have to notify it. I'm very happy with this service, and I'll; I tried six to seven cloud services before I settled with Serverspace. I am glad that I found it. All I need was a reliable, scalable, economical, and user-friendly server for my data crunching and web application. First, their pricing is way attractive. The bigger sites may start with some low teaser rates or even free credits, but their prices go up exponentially with more CPU and memory. Serverspace's pricing remains very reasonable. Granted they don't offer super big servers, I don't need them either. The other thing I like is that they charge significantly less when you turn off the server while other sites charge you the same. I like their simple offers; simple servers that let me build my own environments. The plethora of bells and whistles elsewhere turn me off. Their servers are generally reliable except they failed to turn on a couple of times. But they fixed it promptly and were responsive through the process. Their clean and intuitive web UI is helpful.; I work most of the time but I also trade forex to make some extra money. Since I am not always at home, I had to get an expert advisor for my trades and that was when I started looking for a reliable VPS service. I have been using Serverspace VPS for less than a year now and I can say it has been a peaceful experience in the sense that I never had to worry about shutting down of the server. It's very pocket-friendly and I like that I can pay daily as I use it. What I enjoy most is the option to shutdown a server without deleting or destroying it completely, that way I can restart the server when I need it and continue using it. Like I said, you only get charged for what you use. For a little fee, you also have the option to increase the size or speed of a VPS server if your work becomes bigger without having to get a new server. I can only hope to get more than 50 Mbps speed for the fixed plan as it takes more time to work when everything is so slow.; I have been using Serverspace for about 6 months now. System performance is good. I have never used a VPS before, so I need some help getting up and running. Support always answers back thru a support ticket, although you may have to wait up to 6 hours sometimes, the support is good. Their pricing has been great, and I plan to stay with the service.; Before I decided to use their servers to host our services, I checked out and tried many alternatives. Some time ago I found Serverspace at some offers comparer and I decided to give it a try and I'm really satisfied. There are no problems with servers which I met using servers from others. So at the moment, I think I will use Serverspace servers for my other projects and initiatives.; I like Serverspace! The relation between the purchase price and the performance is perfect. I like dealing with you because of the cheap prices and high performance. Also, the support team is fast, I always get my tickets resolved as fast as possible. The deployment of services is also fast. In general, I do have a good experience and would like to build a long-term relationship.; The uptime and the speed of the service are fantastic. The quality of support is second to none. Every time I need help, I get a very personalized answer and they always go the extra mile to solve my problem. I have tried many competitors in the past but none of them come close to the quality of service I am getting in Serverspace."

They have a feature which allows me to capture full page screenshots of my webpages in scores of different devices. I could even capture web pages that are locally hosted. And now, they have come up with a browser that lets me not only capture screenshots but interact with my websites in 25+ different devices, in a side by side view. That allows me to test my website responsiveness on a bunch of devices in a live-interactive manner. I must admit I am highly impressed by the LT browser and I am a tough guy to impress.; We use LambdaTest across our development & testing team. Our developers always perform cross browser tests on their local pages across different browsers and their versions before sending them to the testers. The integrations with 3rd party tools make it more useful. It provides a full development environment that looks very close to the real thing.Before we started using LambdaTest, we're limited to the browsers and their versions that are available on our desktops and laptops. But now with LambdaTest, we are using Selenium grid of 2000+ browsers and their versions available on the platform.If you want a solution to replace testing infrastructure that is hard to main and look after, LambdaTest is the best solution according to us.; Have been using Lambdatest for around 1 year now, and could say that it’s a useful testing tool for our team. Offering great combinations of browsers and operating systems for you to test on and most importantly there are many types of additional logs that come with each test which helps in debugging.. Glad to see the integration with Travis CI due to which we could optimally use this tool with our CI CD pipelines directly.

MetaDesign Solutions,cloud-computing-companies,"
 $50 - $99/hr ",2007,"We selected MetaDesign after evaluating several firms that each proposed a solution for our needs. MetaDesign worked with us throughout the process, providing recommendations on best practices, prototyping, development, and testing. They set up a cloud environment and provide a hosted solution including support on an ongoing basis. We had a team lead who worked with us directly and other developers as needed. We use the software on a daily basis in connection with our production process. It reliably performs exactly the function we need it to perform.Our team lead is responsive and available, reliably delivering work products on time. MetaDesign is responsive, they know what to do and they do what they say they are going to do!We are very satisfied with MetaDesign.; I have been working with MetaDesign Solutions for many years now and I can confidently say that this is one of the best companies that I've ever come across. The team is very professional and responsive, they work hard to understand the vision of their clients, and they provide excellent quality. They also help me design my app in a cost-effective manner. I highly recommend MetaDesign Solutions to anyone who needs an app or software development company; Have worked with Metadesign on multiple projects for more than 5 years now. They have a wide range of skills and keep themselves current with new technologies and approaches, so they have been able to meet our evolving needs for tech development. They have end-to-end capability and in a couple of cases they are the technology arm of my organization. They are very transparent in all their communications and interactions. So I have never been blindsighted by a key resource resigning for example. Would certainly recommend them to others; I highly recommend Amit and his team to anyone looking for a knowledgeable developer who is easy to work with and can quickly build a sophisticated scalable product. Throughout the development process, they became part of my team and were extremely proactive in tweaking and improving the product based on customer feedback. Furthermore, they always went out of their way to guide me on the best development practices to test, build and scale a product. It was a pleasure working with them and highly recommend them to everyone.; We decided to work with MetaDesign Solutions for our project as we found their offer appealing as well as affordable, especially considering our requirements.

Codebay,cloud-computing-companies,"
$25 - $49/hr ",2014,"Once the first part of the project was released it was a considerable change, we eliminated manual records in the inventories and we managed to digitize our product information.And something that we did not consider, but had a positive impact, was sending everything to the cloud, when the pandemic hit we were forced to close the offices, so since everything was digital, the administrative functions, new orders, registrations and among others, were not seen affected.; There is constant communication, during the project there is a general review every three weeks; also, we had daily meetings to define activities, which allowed us to have a very quick response to any issue with the platform.Although the project was not without delays, these were minimal and were quickly corrected. The final project was delivered and implemented without major complications. Currently the Codebay team provides us with support and system updates.; We hire them for the development of a web application. A member of their team, Luis Sanchez was in charge of the project, we had several meetings to define the content and structure of the first sites. Later, he presented us graphic proposals and based on this, they began to develop. During development there were adjustments; Comparing them with the company I had worked with before, their communications are way superior. I always know exactly what they're working on, specifically the stage of the process where they're at. In addition, they're always upfront whenever things might take longer than expected. However, for the most part, they've completed things in a timely manner or even ahead of schedule.; We started working with a cloud specialist, who reviewed our current systems and implemented a work plan to migrate to the cloud. The process did not take that long, but we had complications migrating the information as our old servers were constantly crashing due to the workload. Eventually we managed to migrate everything, and from there Codebay has provided us with maintenance services.; We start by planning the different stages of development with the support of an architect and the design area. We already had a system made in .NET, so the new platform was programmed in the same language. The development had different variables which took a year to complete, currently we continue working with them with support and system improvements.; We have worked together for a few months and it has been a positive experience, the team besides being very committed to development, they have shown good technical skills. The management team has been aware of any issue and has been very open to follow up on doubts.; Codebay has served as the supporting development team for a startup incubation university.

LambdaTest,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2017,"Being a developer, responsive testing comes as a part of the package, every time I develop a webpage. I have been relying over LambdaTest for responsive testing. They have a feature which allows me to capture full page screenshots of my webpages in scores of different devices. I could even capture web pages that are locally hosted. And now, they have come up with a browser that lets me not only capture screenshots but interact with my websites in 25+ different devices, in a side by side view. That allows me to test my website responsiveness on a bunch of devices in a live-interactive manner. I must admit I am highly impressed by the LT browser and I am a tough guy to impress.; We use LambdaTest across our development & testing team. Our developers always perform cross browser tests on their local pages across different browsers and their versions before sending them to the testers. The integrations with 3rd party tools make it more useful. It provides a full development environment that looks very close to the real thing.Before we started using LambdaTest, we're limited to the browsers and their versions that are available on our desktops and laptops. But now with LambdaTest, we are using Selenium grid of 2000+ browsers and their versions available on the platform.If you want a solution to replace testing infrastructure that is hard to main and look after, LambdaTest is the best solution according to us.; Have been using Lambdatest for around 1 year now, and could say that it’s a useful testing tool for our team. Offering great combinations of browsers and operating systems for you to test on and most importantly there are many types of additional logs that come with each test which helps in debugging.. Glad to see the integration with Travis CI due to which we could optimally use this tool with our CI CD pipelines directly. We were able to effectively run TestNG and Selenium tests using their documentation and as an added advantage their support team is quick and helpful.; The industry we function (e-commerce) has a broad category of audience. We need to make sure our website is accessible to everyone irrespective of the browser / operating system they use. Ofcourse, responsive web design check is a major bullet point over our testing checklist as well. As a B2C, it's crucial for us to stay ahead of the customers and we wanted a solution which could help us ensure our changes would work seamlessly when shipped to the Production. LambdaTest made a great fit here when considered the latest browsers on the product, ability to test local pages along with a complimentary access to LT browser which is an absolute delight for our developers and testers. It helps us save a considerable effort on responsive testing plus the native developer tools allow us to dig deep into any UI mismatch! Also As mentioned we could achieve wider test coverage in time by running multiple combinations of browsers in parallel with LambdaTest automation suite. Our director to purchase the subscription was due to their affordable pricing for the parallel tests and the communication from the support team!; Running tests serially can be a good option when your product is at an early stage. But as we scaled the product, we needed a tool to reduce test time execution and pace up our test cycles. LambdaTest simplified the Selenium testing experience for us with their cloud based platform which allowed us to execute our test cases in parallel on hundreds of browsers. We could easily automate the test cases, get the sessions recorded and share the test reports across the team for assessment using Asana integration. We even leverage the integration with CircleCI to run automated tests on LambdaTest through our pipeline. The CircleCI Orb is handy for testing our privately hosted application.It’s good to see now that using LambdaTest we could run multiple tests on multiple VM’s, saving us hours of testing time and maintenance cost of local infrastructure. Personally, one thing that LambdaTest does very well is continuing to provide tutorials for testing, so that we stay up to speed and are even able to learn new things.I definitely saw myself applying a lot of the new concepts that I learned from their blogs.; As technology advances, enterprises are switching from manual testing to Selenium Test Automation. But one area most enterprises are still struggling is with the scalability of running several tests in parallel. LambdaTest has been a boon for us when it comes to Selenium automation. With a Selenium Grid based on the cloud, we don't need to stress about setting up and maintaining infrastructure anymore. We can run hundreds of tests in parallel on 2000+ browsers and OS versions running on real machines. LambdaTest really helped us in reducing our web testing cost and at the same time scale it as and when required.To leverage on marketing campaigns, we needed to ensure all our deliverables render seamlessly on different mobile and desktop browsers our users use to view them from across the world. The geolocation testing functionality helped us set the location and test our website over various locations. At LambdaTest, we can now run geolocation testing to test our website across 40+ countries. The pricing plan is pretty simple and easy to grasp, with no hidden costs at all.; We needed a testing tool that was scalable enough to cover all the browsers and OS as per our clients requirement and at the same time integrate well into our workflow. Lambdatest provided us with the necessary features to meet our browser compatibility testing requirements. Without any hassle of configuring, installing or maintaining the virtual machines, we are able to launch local browser tests instantly. The best part is, Lambdatest also helps us run our Selenium based automated tests on its cloud infra - that too without burning a hole in our pocket. They offer extensive mobile and desktop browsers, thereby increasing our test coverage to maximum.; We serve a variety of clients across industries, thus we need to make sure our website is accessible from every desktop, mobile browser combination they use. Responsive web design is an integral part of our testing process. As a B2B, you want to make sure that your services are always a step ahead of your customers. And to achieve that, it's important to have a tool that keeps your code and web designing process in sync with the Production.LambdaTest's variety of browsers and local testing capabilities made it a perfect fit for our requirements. Additionally we got free access to LT Browser which is absolutely loved by our developers. We are now in a better position while tackling misbehaving websites with the help of it’s inbuilt dev tools. The best part is that LambdaTest offers an automated parallel testing that helped us achieve faster and wider test coverage over multiple browsers. Its affordable price and fast technical support made the purchase decision very easy for the team. And yes I absolutely love their support staff. They are truly available for 24*7.; While we develop our web applications, our top concern was to verify the unintentional changes to the application's visuals. We need to make sure that changing one component doesn't break the styling of another component. LambdaTest's Smart testing helped us to identify visual regression bugs for every new build. We could capture our website screenshots belonging to different environments i.e stage and production & upload them on the LambdaTest Visual Testing platform. We were able to discover visual deviations with pixel to pixel comparison by capturing screenshots, comparing them against the baseline image, and highlighting visual changes. The slider mode is very helpful to compare the visual discrepancies between the two images by toggling them. Overall, Smart testing helped us perform reliable visual testing at scale and eliminated the risk of delivering visual bugs."
Serverspace,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2019,"First of all I would like to thank Serverspace for this great platform! Out of other VPS services, this is my favorite, it offers me the flexibility to enhance my skills as a Full-Stack Developer as well as a server administrator. Well out of frustrations from other VPS services, since they have a lot of hassle to work on, this platform enabled me to easily pick my choice, add new memory capability just by a few clicks. I observed the great UI/UX of this platform, and I am planning to use this forever until this platform is still working.; I tried many cloud server providers like AWS, Azure, Google cloud and more but they didn't satisfy my needs but when I tried Serverspace I was shocked because of their server prices, for a startup that will be the best option, I saw that the price is low but the service is best as expensive, I am fully satisfied with this. I recommend Serverspace for startups once a time you see, a cybercriminal attacked my server in serverspace but... the company has reported me on time, so I saved my server from further attacks, Serverspace saved a lot of time and money.; What I like about this company is the many options offered to us customers since I'm a Windows/Linux User and most of my needs rely on multi-OS systems. That's why I run 4 servers with ServerSpace. Their Windows Machines are as good as you can imagine, they offer all the alternatives I need, and I also run servers with CentOS. With Serverspace, I can cover all my needs for my business, and the best part is I also have different options on the payment side. They only charge me for the current use and not a whole monthly amount in advance, and I can cancel any server I ordered at any second. Also, their support tickets get answered right away. It's pretty good. What I think they could do better is improve their automatic system detecting payments with Ever. Every time I pay with Ever, I have to send a support ticket with transaction ID and all info about the payment to add funds. I get a reply the same day, but I'd rather not have to notify it. I'm very happy with this service, and I'll; I tried six to seven cloud services before I settled with Serverspace. I am glad that I found it. All I need was a reliable, scalable, economical, and user-friendly server for my data crunching and web application. First, their pricing is way attractive. The bigger sites may start with some low teaser rates or even free credits, but their prices go up exponentially with more CPU and memory. Serverspace's pricing remains very reasonable. Granted they don't offer super big servers, I don't need them either. The other thing I like is that they charge significantly less when you turn off the server while other sites charge you the same. I like their simple offers; simple servers that let me build my own environments. The plethora of bells and whistles elsewhere turn me off. Their servers are generally reliable except they failed to turn on a couple of times. But they fixed it promptly and were responsive through the process. Their clean and intuitive web UI is helpful.; I work most of the time but I also trade forex to make some extra money. Since I am not always at home, I had to get an expert advisor for my trades and that was when I started looking for a reliable VPS service. I have been using Serverspace VPS for less than a year now and I can say it has been a peaceful experience in the sense that I never had to worry about shutting down of the server. It's very pocket-friendly and I like that I can pay daily as I use it. What I enjoy most is the option to shutdown a server without deleting or destroying it completely, that way I can restart the server when I need it and continue using it. Like I said, you only get charged for what you use. For a little fee, you also have the option to increase the size or speed of a VPS server if your work becomes bigger without having to get a new server.

LambdaTest,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2017,"Being a developer, responsive testing comes as a part of the package, every time I develop a webpage. I have been relying over LambdaTest for responsive testing. They have a feature which allows me to capture full page screenshots of my webpages in scores of different devices. I could even capture web pages that are locally hosted. And now, they have come up with a browser that lets me not only capture screenshots but interact with my websites in 25+ different devices, in a side by side view. That allows me to test my website responsiveness on a bunch of devices in a live-interactive manner. I must admit I am highly impressed by the LT browser and I am a tough guy to impress.; We use LambdaTest across our development & testing team. Our developers always perform cross browser tests on their local pages across different browsers and their versions before sending them to the testers. The integrations with 3rd party tools make it more useful. It provides a full development environment that looks very close to the real thing.Before we started using LambdaTest, we're limited to the browsers and their versions that are available on our desktops and laptops. But now with LambdaTest, we are using Selenium grid of 2000+ browsers and their versions available on the platform.If you want a solution to replace testing infrastructure that is hard to main and look after, LambdaTest is the best solution according to us.; Have been using Lambdatest for around 1 year now, and could say that it’s a useful testing tool for our team. Offering great combinations of browsers and operating systems for you to test on and most importantly there are many types of additional logs that come with each test which helps in debugging.. Glad to see the integration with Travis CI due to which we could optimally use this tool with our CI CD pipelines directly. We were able to effectively run TestNG and Selenium tests using their documentation and as an added advantage their support team is quick and helpful.; The industry we function (e-commerce) has a broad category of audience. We need to make sure our website is accessible to everyone irrespective of the browser / operating system they use. Ofcourse, responsive web design check is a major bullet point over our testing checklist as well. As a B2C, it's crucial for us to stay ahead of the customers and we wanted a solution which could help us ensure our changes would work seamlessly when shipped to the Production. LambdaTest made a great fit here when considered the latest browsers on the product, ability to test local pages along with a complimentary access to LT browser which is an absolute delight for our developers and testers. It helps us save a considerable effort on responsive testing plus the native developer tools allow us to dig deep into any UI mismatch! Also As mentioned we could achieve wider test coverage in time by running multiple combinations of browsers in parallel with LambdaTest automation suite. Our director to purchase the subscription was due to their affordable pricing for the parallel tests and the communication from the support team!; Running tests serially can be a good option when your product is at an early stage. But as we scaled the product, we needed a tool to reduce test time execution and pace up our test cycles. LambdaTest simplified the Selenium testing experience for us with their cloud based platform which allowed us to execute our test cases in parallel on hundreds of browsers. We could easily automate the test cases, get the sessions recorded and share the test reports across the team for assessment using Asana integration. We even leverage the integration with CircleCI to run automated tests on LambdaTest through our pipeline. The CircleCI Orb is handy for testing our privately hosted application.It’s good to see now that using LambdaTest we could run multiple tests on multiple VM’s, saving us hours of testing time and maintenance cost of local infrastructure. Personally, one thing that LambdaTest does very well is continuing to provide tutorials for testing, so that we stay up to speed and are even able to learn new things.I definitely saw myself applying a lot of the new concepts that I learned from their blogs.; As technology advances, enterprises are switching from manual testing to Selenium Test Automation. But one area most enterprises are still struggling is with the scalability of running several tests in parallel. LambdaTest has been a boon for us when it comes to Selenium automation. With a Selenium Grid based on the cloud, we don't need to stress about setting up and maintaining infrastructure anymore. We can run hundreds of tests in parallel on 2000+ browsers and OS versions running on real machines. LambdaTest really helped us in reducing our web testing cost and at the same time scale it as and when required.To leverage on marketing campaigns, we needed to ensure all our deliverables render seamlessly on different mobile and desktop browsers our users use to view them from across the world. The geolocation testing functionality helped us set the location and test our website over various locations. At LambdaTest, we can now run geolocation testing to test our website across 40+ countries. The pricing plan is pretty simple and easy to grasp, with no hidden costs at all.; We needed a testing tool that was scalable enough to cover all the browsers and OS as per our clients requirement and at the same time integrate well into our workflow. Lambdatest provided us with the necessary features to meet our browser compatibility testing requirements. Without any hassle of configuring, installing or maintaining the virtual machines, we are able to launch local browser tests instantly. The best part is, Lambdatest also helps us run our Selenium based automated tests on its cloud infra - that too without burning a hole in our pocket. They offer extensive mobile and desktop browsers, thereby increasing our test coverage to maximum.; We serve a variety of clients across industries, thus we need to make sure our website is accessible from every desktop, mobile browser combination they use. Responsive web design is an integral part of our testing process. As a B2B, you want to make sure that your services are always a step ahead of your customers. And to achieve that, it's important to have a tool that keeps your code and web designing process in sync with the Production.LambdaTest's variety of browsers and local testing capabilities made it a perfect fit for our requirements. Additionally we got free access to LT Browser which is absolutely loved by our developers. We are now in a better position while tackling misbehaving websites with the help of it’s inbuilt dev tools. The best part is that LambdaTest offers an automated parallel testing that helped us achieve faster and wider test coverage over multiple browsers. Its affordable price and fast technical support made the purchase decision very easy for the team. And yes I absolutely love their support staff. They are truly available for 24*7.; While we develop our web applications, our top concern was to verify the unintentional changes to the application's visuals. We need to make sure that changing one component doesn't break the styling of another component. LambdaTest's Smart testing helped us to identify visual regression bugs for every new build. We could capture our website screenshots belonging to different environments i.e stage and production & upload them on the LambdaTest Visual Testing platform. We were able to discover visual deviations with pixel to pixel comparison by capturing screenshots, comparing them against the baseline image, and highlighting visual changes. The slider mode is very helpful to compare the visual discrepancies between the two images by toggling them. Overall, Smart testing helped us perform reliable visual testing at scale and eliminated the risk of delivering visual bugs."
Serverspace,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2019,"First of all I would like to thank Serverspace for this great platform! Out of other VPS services, this is my favorite, it offers me the flexibility to enhance my skills as a Full-Stack Developer as well as a server administrator. Well out of frustrations from other VPS services, since they have a lot of hassle to work on, this platform enabled me to easily pick my choice, add new memory capability just by a few clicks. I observed the great UI/UX of this platform, and I am planning to use this forever until this platform is still working.; I tried many cloud server providers like AWS, Azure, Google cloud and more but they didn't satisfy my needs but when I tried Serverspace I was shocked because of their server prices, for a startup that will be the best option, I saw that the price is low but the service is best as expensive, I am fully satisfied with this. I recommend Serverspace for startups once a time you see, a cybercriminal attacked my server in serverspace but... the company has reported me on time, so I saved my server from further attacks, Serverspace saved a lot of time and money.; What I like about this company is the many options offered to us customers since I'm a Windows/Linux User and most of my needs rely on multi-OS systems. That's why I run 4 servers with ServerSpace. Their Windows Machines are as good as you can imagine, they offer all the alternatives I need, and I also run servers with CentOS. With Serverspace, I can cover all my needs for my business, and the best part is I also have different options on the payment side. They only charge me for the current use and not a whole monthly amount in advance, and I can cancel any server I ordered at any second. Also, their support tickets get answered right away. It's pretty good. What I think they could do better is improve their automatic system detecting payments with Ever. Every time I pay with Ever, I have to send a support ticket with transaction ID and all info about the payment to add funds. I get a reply the same day, but I'd rather not have to notify it. I'm very happy with this service, and I'll; I tried six to seven cloud services before I settled with Serverspace. I am glad that I found it. All I need was a reliable, scalable, economical, and user-friendly server for my data crunching and web application. First, their pricing is way attractive. The bigger sites may start with some low teaser rates or even free credits, but their prices go up exponentially with more CPU and memory. Serverspace's pricing remains very reasonable. Granted they don't offer super big servers, I don't need them either. The other thing I like is that they charge significantly less when you turn off the server while other sites charge you the same. I like their simple offers; simple servers that let me build my own environments. The plethora of bells and whistles elsewhere turn me off. Their servers are generally reliable except they failed to turn on a couple of times. But they fixed it promptly and were responsive through the process. Their clean and intuitive web UI is helpful.; I work most of the time but I also trade forex to make some extra money. Since I am not always at home, I had to get an expert advisor for my trades and that was when I started looking for a reliable VPS service. I have been using Serverspace VPS for less than a year now and I can say it has been a peaceful experience in the sense that I never had to worry about shutting down of the server. It's very pocket-friendly and I like that I can pay daily as I use it. What I enjoy most is the option to shutdown a server without deleting or destroying it completely, that way I can restart the server when I need it and continue using it. Like I said, you only get charged for what you use. For a little fee, you also have the option to increase the size or speed of a VPS server if your work becomes bigger without having to get a new server. I can only hope to get more than 50 Mbps speed for the fixed plan as it takes more time to work when everything is so slow.; I have been using Serverspace for about 6 months now. System performance is good. I have never used a VPS before, so I need some help getting up and running. Support always answers back thru a support ticket, although you may have to wait up to 6 hours sometimes, the support is good. Their pricing has been great, and I plan to stay with the service.; Before I decided to use their servers to host our services, I checked out and tried many alternatives. Some time ago I found Serverspace at some offers comparer and I decided to give it a try and I'm really satisfied. There are no problems with servers which I met using servers from others. So at the moment, I think I will use Serverspace servers for my other projects and initiatives.; I like Serverspace! The relation between the purchase price and the performance is perfect. I like dealing with you because of the cheap prices and high performance. Also, the support team is fast, I always get my tickets resolved as fast as possible. The deployment of services is also fast. In general, I do have a good experience and would like to build a long-term relationship.; The uptime and the speed of the service are fantastic. The quality of support is second to none. Every time I need help, I get a very personalized answer and they always go the extra mile to solve my problem. I have tried many competitors in the past but none of them come close to the quality of service I am getting in Serverspace."

$25 - $49/hr ",2004,"We are a startup fintech company and needed to develop a mobile app in iOS and Android. The app is a social media platform for investing with back end analytics similar to Twitter. The development required integration with a high end data provider and a separate charting platform. After interviewing multiple (8) companies, I selected Alliancetek because they were experienced, offered end to end solutions beyond a standard mobile app firm, and their price point was below competing firms.Alliancetek delivered on all promises with great professionalism. We had to pivot several times in the course of the project and each hurdle was handled without a hitch. My “team” consisted of 3 Alliancetek employees (1 project manager, 1 iOS developer, 1 Android developer) who I spoke with weekly through Microsoft Team meetings. There were additional back end developers who worked on the project. I had an outstanding experience and give Alliancetek my highest recommendation.; My company was close to the launch date for a software platform that allows aspiring US college athletes to get recruited. It was a complex system involving many different elements, user types and features. With our primary in-house developer, we were running very late on our development schedule. We had a few months left to finish off the system before our customers began to use it. We brought AllianceTek on and they helped us get over the line with their amazing, responsive and high quality work. Without their tremendous work, we would not have been able to get over the line and give our customers a product that would be helpful to them. AllianceTek were honestly a game changer, and I could not imagine being where we are today as a company without their heavy and continued involvement.; The project has moved extremely smooth. The communication, the Dev team, I mean all of you guys over at Alliance Tech have just blown away my expectations and I can't thank you guys enough for helping me bring this idea into a reality. This is going to, not just revolutionise the industry, but revolutionise sales training in general. it's going to be able to present different scenarios, to the training platform getting feedback and uploading their videos to train to where we can train hundreds of people at the same time. I mean guys, this software that you guys have helped bring to life is truly going to change the industry.; Sokolis Group has been working with AllianceTek for almost a decade. We partnered with them to design and build a proprietary application that is critical to our business for analyzing and reporting our clients' fuel transaction data. Over the years, we have continued to work with AllianceTek to develop new features which helped make our business more efficient and our reporting to clients more insightful. In addition, AllianceTek provides the hosting and maintenance for this cloud-based application and we trust them to handle this important responsibility. They are a valued partner to our business and I would not hesitate to recommend them.; I work for a boutique leadership and communication consulting firm. As part of our service offerings, we provide clients a private and secure performance / developmental review site where employees are able to provide one another feedback on a regular cadence. We initially used an internal site, but as the scale of our projects and clients began to increase, we knew we needed to increase the sophistication of our site. That's where AllianceTek came in. Working together hand-in-hand, we developed a site tailored to the needs of our clients. Since development of the site, we've had clients ask for increased personalization and customization, and AllianceTek has been able to help us develop these in an expedient and efficient manner. Another bonus is that even after several years of working together, we've had the same points of contact throughout. This has been an invaluable part of us working together so well. After the past few years of working together, I couldn't recommend AllianceTek highly enough.; ; AllianceTek has delivered outstanding products and services which has helped Strategas achieve outstanding recognition from our financial services clients. Beyond those technical achievements, what sets this team apart from the crowd is the rapid responsiveness to my requests, be it a production problem, coding change, or business challenge; that kind of responsiveness is an exceptional work ethic not frequently seen in our industry and highly valued by my firm. I can always count upon this team to respond in kind with their best efforts.; ; "
LambdaTest,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2017,"Being a developer, responsive testing comes as a part of the package, every time I develop a webpage. I have been relying over LambdaTest for responsive testing. They have a feature which allows me to capture full page screenshots of my webpages in scores of different devices. I could even capture web pages that are locally hosted. And now, they have come up with a browser that lets me not only capture screenshots but interact with my websites in 25+ different devices, in a side by side view. That allows me to test my website responsiveness on a bunch of devices in a live-interactive manner. I must admit I am highly impressed by the LT browser and I am a tough guy to impress.; We use LambdaTest across our development & testing team. Our developers always perform cross browser tests on their local pages across different browsers and their versions before sending them to the testers. The integrations with 3rd party tools make it more useful. It provides a full development environment that looks very close to the real thing.Before we started using LambdaTest, we're limited to the browsers and their versions that are available on our desktops and laptops. But now with LambdaTest, we are using Selenium grid of 2000+ browsers and their versions available on the platform.If you want a solution to replace testing infrastructure that is hard to main and look after, LambdaTest is the best solution according to us.; Have been using Lambdatest for around 1 year now, and could say that it’s a useful testing tool for our team. Offering great combinations of browsers and operating systems for you to test on and most importantly there are many types of additional logs that come with each test which helps in debugging.. Glad to see the integration with Travis CI due to which we could optimally use this tool with our CI CD pipelines directly. We were able to effectively run TestNG and Selenium tests using their documentation and as an added advantage their support team is quick and helpful.; The industry we function (e-commerce) has a broad category of audience. We need to make sure our website is accessible to everyone irrespective of the browser / operating system they use. Ofcourse, responsive web design check is a major bullet point over our testing checklist as well. As a B2C, it's crucial for us to stay ahead of the customers and we wanted a solution which could help us ensure our changes would work seamlessly when shipped to the Production. LambdaTest made a great fit here when considered the latest browsers on the product, ability to test local pages along with a complimentary access to LT browser which is an absolute delight for our developers and testers. It helps us save a considerable effort on responsive testing plus the native developer tools allow us to dig deep into any UI mismatch! Also As mentioned we could achieve wider test coverage in time by running multiple combinations of browsers in parallel with LambdaTest automation suite. Our director to purchase the subscription was due to their affordable pricing for the parallel tests and the communication from the support team!; Running tests serially can be a good option when your product is at an early stage. But as we scaled the product, we needed a tool to reduce test time execution and pace up our test cycles. LambdaTest simplified the Selenium testing experience for us with their cloud based platform which allowed us to execute our test cases in parallel on hundreds of browsers. We could easily automate the test cases, get the sessions recorded and share the test reports across the team for assessment using Asana integration. We even leverage the integration with CircleCI to run automated tests on LambdaTest through our pipeline. The CircleCI Orb is handy for testing our privately hosted application.It’s good to see now that using LambdaTest we could run multiple tests on multiple VM’s, saving us hours of testing time and maintenance cost of local infrastructure. Personally, one thing that LambdaTest does very well is continuing to provide tutorials for testing, so that we stay up to speed and are even able to learn new things.I definitely saw myself applying a lot of the new concepts that I learned from their blogs.; As technology advances, enterprises are switching from manual testing to Selenium Test Automation. But one area most enterprises are still struggling is with the scalability of running several tests in parallel. LambdaTest has been a boon for us when it comes to Selenium automation. With a Selenium Grid based on the cloud, we don't need to stress about setting up and maintaining infrastructure anymore. We can run hundreds of tests in parallel on 2000+ browsers and OS versions running on real machines. LambdaTest really helped us in reducing our web testing cost and at the same time scale it as and when required.To leverage on marketing campaigns, we needed to ensure all our deliverables render seamlessly on different mobile and desktop browsers our users use to view them from across the world. The geolocation testing functionality helped us set the location and test our website over various locations. At LambdaTest, we can now run geolocation testing to test our website across 40+ countries. The pricing plan is pretty simple and easy to grasp, with no hidden costs at all.; We needed a testing tool that was scalable enough to cover all the browsers and OS as per our clients requirement and at the same time integrate well into our workflow. Lambdatest provided us with the necessary features to meet our browser compatibility testing requirements. Without any hassle of configuring, installing or maintaining the virtual machines, we are able to launch local browser tests instantly. The best part is, Lambdatest also helps us run our Selenium based automated tests on its cloud infra - that too without burning a hole in our pocket. They offer extensive mobile and desktop browsers, thereby increasing our test coverage to maximum.; We serve a variety of clients across industries, thus we need to make sure our website is accessible from every desktop, mobile browser combination they use. Responsive web design is an integral part of our testing process. As a B2B, you want to make sure that your services are always a step ahead of your customers. And to achieve that, it's important to have a tool that keeps your code and web designing process in sync with the Production.LambdaTest's variety of browsers and local testing capabilities made it a perfect fit for our requirements. Additionally we got free access to LT Browser which is absolutely loved by our developers. We are now in a better position while tackling misbehaving websites with the help of it’s inbuilt dev tools. The best part is that LambdaTest offers an automated parallel testing that helped us achieve faster and wider test coverage over multiple browsers. Its affordable price and fast technical support made the purchase decision very easy for the team. And yes I absolutely love their support staff. They are truly available for 24*7.; While we develop our web applications, our top concern was to verify the unintentional changes to the application's visuals. We need to make sure that changing one component doesn't break the styling of another component. LambdaTest's Smart testing helped us to identify visual regression bugs for every new build. We could capture our website screenshots belonging to different environments i.e stage and production & upload them on the LambdaTest Visual Testing platform. We were able to discover visual deviations with pixel to pixel comparison by capturing screenshots, comparing them against the baseline image, and highlighting visual changes. The slider mode is very helpful to compare the visual discrepancies between the two images by toggling them. Overall, Smart testing helped us perform reliable visual testing at scale and eliminated the risk of delivering visual bugs."
Serverspace,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2019,"First of all I would like to thank Serverspace for this great platform! Out of other VPS services, this is my favorite, it offers me the flexibility to enhance my skills as a Full-Stack Developer as well as a server administrator. Well out of frustrations from other VPS services, since they have a lot of hassle to work on, this platform enabled me to easily pick my choice, add new memory capability just by a few clicks. I observed the great UI/UX of this platform, and I am planning to use this forever until this platform is still working.; I tried many cloud server providers like AWS, Azure, Google cloud and more but they didn't satisfy my needs but when I tried Serverspace I was shocked because of their server prices, for a startup that will be the best option, I saw that the price is low but the service is best as expensive, I am fully satisfied with this. I recommend Serverspace for startups once a time you see, a cybercriminal attacked my server in serverspace but... the company has reported me on time, so I saved my server from further attacks, Serverspace saved a lot of time and money.; What I like about this company is the many options offered to us customers since I'm a Windows/Linux User and most of my needs rely on multi-OS systems. That's why I run 4 servers with ServerSpace. Their Windows Machines are as good as you can imagine, they offer all the alternatives I need, and I also run servers with CentOS. With Serverspace, I can cover all my needs for my business, and the best part is I also have different options on the payment side. They only charge me for the current use and not a whole monthly amount in advance, and I can cancel any server I ordered at any second. Also, their support tickets get answered right away. It's pretty good. What I think they could do better is improve their automatic system detecting payments with Ever. Every time I pay with Ever, I have to send a support ticket with transaction ID and all info about the payment to add funds. I get a reply the same day, but I'd rather not have to notify it. I'm very happy with this service, and I'll; I tried six to seven cloud services before I settled with Serverspace. I am glad that I found it. All I need was a reliable, scalable, economical, and user-friendly server for my data crunching and web application. First, their pricing is way attractive. The bigger sites may start with some low teaser rates or even free credits, but their prices go up exponentially with more CPU and memory. Serverspace's pricing remains very reasonable. Granted they don't offer super big servers, I don't need them either. The other thing I like is that they charge significantly less when you turn off the server while other sites charge you the same. I like their simple offers; simple servers that let me build my own environments. The plethora of bells and whistles elsewhere turn me off. Their servers are generally reliable except they failed to turn on a couple of times. But they fixed it promptly and were responsive through the process. Their clean and intuitive web UI is helpful.; I work most of the time but I also trade forex to make some extra money. Since I am not always at home, I had to get an expert advisor for my trades and that was when I started looking for a reliable VPS service. I have been using Serverspace VPS for less than a year now and I can say it has been a peaceful experience in the sense that I never had to worry about shutting down of the server. It's very pocket-friendly and I like that I can pay daily as I use it. What I enjoy most is the option to shutdown a server without deleting or destroying it completely, that way I can restart the server when I need it and continue using it. Like I said, you only get charged for what you use. For a little fee, you also have the option to increase the size or speed of a VPS server if your work becomes bigger without having to get a new server. I can only hope to get more than 50 Mbps speed for the fixed plan as it takes more time to work when everything is so slow.; I have been using Serverspace for about 6 months now. System performance is good. I have never used a VPS before, so I need some help getting up and running. Support always answers back thru a support ticket, although you may have to wait up to 6 hours sometimes, the support is good. Their pricing has been great, and I plan to stay with the service.; Before I decided to use their servers to host our services, I checked out and tried many alternatives. Some time ago I found Serverspace at some offers comparer and I decided to give it a try and I'm really satisfied. There are no problems with servers which I met using servers from others. So at the moment, I think I will use Serverspace servers for my other projects and initiatives.; I like Serverspace! The relation between the purchase price and the performance is perfect. I like dealing with you because of the cheap prices and high performance. Also, the support team is fast, I always get my tickets resolved as fast as possible. The deployment of services is also fast. In general, I do have a good experience and would like to build a long-term relationship.; The uptime and the speed of the service are fantastic. The quality of support is second to none. Every time I need help, I get a very personalized answer and they always go the extra mile to solve my problem. I have tried many competitors in the past but none of them come close to the quality of service I am getting in Serverspace."

In addition, AllianceTek provides the hosting and maintenance for this cloud-based application and we trust them to handle this important responsibility. They are a valued partner to our business and I would not hesitate to recommend them.; I work for a boutique leadership and communication consulting firm. As part of our service offerings, we provide clients a private and secure performance / developmental review site where employees are able to provide one another feedback on a regular cadence. We initially used an internal site, but as the scale of our projects and clients began to increase, we knew we needed to increase the sophistication of our site. That's where AllianceTek came in. Working together hand-in-hand, we developed a site tailored to the needs of our clients. Since development of the site, we've had clients ask for increased personalization and customization, and AllianceTek has been able to help us develop these in an expedient and efficient manner. Another bonus is that even after several years of working together, we've had the same points of contact throughout. This has been an invaluable part of us working together so well. After the past few years of working together, I couldn't recommend AllianceTek highly enough.; ; AllianceTek has delivered outstanding products and services which has helped Strategas achieve outstanding recognition from our financial services clients. Beyond those technical achievements, what sets this team apart from the crowd is the rapid responsiveness to my requests, be it a production problem, coding change, or business challenge; that kind of responsiveness is an exceptional work ethic not frequently seen in our industry and highly valued by my firm. I can always count upon this team to respond in kind with their best efforts.; ; "
Tudip Technologies Pvt. Ltd.,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2010,"I have been working with Tudip on several projects and what distinguishes a good QA team from Tudip is their consistency, the ability to have great judgement and the attention to detail. They are eager to find what we missed the same ay when they see it for the first time than the 1000th time. They never assume they always double check. Also from a cultural point of view, they have been amazing adapting on how we do things, always there when we need them (Weekends, late night, even during major Indian holidays) and very supportive when things look impossible.; Working with Tudip was a great experience. After working with two other US based development companies and having bad experiences I was a little hesitant. But my worries were put at easy after the first 2 week sprint and I saw how fast they were making progress. My project was eventually completed on time despite issues with secondary API organizations we needed to work with. And even through that whole process Tudip handled it all. Net, anytime I need development work done they are the first company I will go with.; ; ; I've been working with Tudip now for over 2 years and our relationship has continued to grow as we've also grown. They've been able to scale with our team and provide a very high level of service. As the CEO its nice to know that you have an amazing team such as Tudip Technologies and Dipti the CEO, to support our mission. We foresee a continued growing relationship with Dipti's team for many years to come! Remember, ""Life is better with an Amigo""! :); INVESTA is our second large project with Tudip. We have entrusted them several aspects of the Back end due to the sensitive nature of the information that is being handled.They have proven over time a dedication and passion to the project second to none.We are currently working and will carry on with them for the years to come.; Very Professional Customer Services plus very polite and I happy to talk with the nice lady whoever she maybe."
LambdaTest,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2017,"Being a developer, responsive testing comes as a part of the package, every time I develop a webpage. I have been relying over LambdaTest for responsive testing. They have a feature which allows me to capture full page screenshots of my webpages in scores of different devices. I could even capture web pages that are locally hosted. And now, they have come up with a browser that lets me not only capture screenshots but interact with my websites in 25+ different devices, in a side by side view. That allows me to test my website responsiveness on a bunch of devices in a live-interactive manner. I must admit I am highly impressed by the LT browser and I am a tough guy to impress.; We use LambdaTest across our development & testing team. Our developers always perform cross browser tests on their local pages across different browsers and their versions before sending them to the testers. The integrations with 3rd party tools make it more useful. It provides a full development environment that looks very close to the real thing.Before we started using LambdaTest, we're limited to the browsers and their versions that are available on our desktops and laptops. But now with LambdaTest, we are using Selenium grid of 2000+ browsers and their versions available on the platform.If you want a solution to replace testing infrastructure that is hard to main and look after, LambdaTest is the best solution according to us.; Have been using Lambdatest for around 1 year now, and could say that it’s a useful testing tool for our team. Offering great combinations of browsers and operating systems for you to test on and most importantly there are many types of additional logs that come with each test which helps in debugging.. Glad to see the integration with Travis CI due to which we could optimally use this tool with our CI CD pipelines directly. We were able to effectively run TestNG and Selenium tests using their documentation and as an added advantage their support team is quick and helpful.; The industry we function (e-commerce) has a broad category of audience. We need to make sure our website is accessible to everyone irrespective of the browser / operating system they use. Ofcourse, responsive web design check is a major bullet point over our testing checklist as well. As a B2C, it's crucial for us to stay ahead of the customers and we wanted a solution which could help us ensure our changes would work seamlessly when shipped to the Production. LambdaTest made a great fit here when considered the latest browsers on the product, ability to test local pages along with a complimentary access to LT browser which is an absolute delight for our developers and testers. It helps us save a considerable effort on responsive testing plus the native developer tools allow us to dig deep into any UI mismatch! Also As mentioned we could achieve wider test coverage in time by running multiple combinations of browsers in parallel with LambdaTest automation suite. Our director to purchase the subscription was due to their affordable pricing for the parallel tests and the communication from the support team!; Running tests serially can be a good option when your product is at an early stage. But as we scaled the product, we needed a tool to reduce test time execution and pace up our test cycles. LambdaTest simplified the Selenium testing experience for us with their cloud based platform which allowed us to execute our test cases in parallel on hundreds of browsers. We could easily automate the test cases, get the sessions recorded and share the test reports across the team for assessment using Asana integration. We even leverage the integration with CircleCI to run automated tests on LambdaTest through our pipeline. The CircleCI Orb is handy for testing our privately hosted application.It’s good to see now that using LambdaTest we could run multiple tests on multiple VM’s, saving us hours of testing time and maintenance cost of local infrastructure. Personally, one thing that LambdaTest does very well is continuing to provide tutorials for testing, so that we stay up to speed and are even able to learn new things.I definitely saw myself applying a lot of the new concepts that I learned from their blogs.; As technology advances, enterprises are switching from manual testing to Selenium Test Automation. But one area most enterprises are still struggling is with the scalability of running several tests in parallel. LambdaTest has been a boon for us when it comes to Selenium automation. With a Selenium Grid based on the cloud, we don't need to stress about setting up and maintaining infrastructure anymore. We can run hundreds of tests in parallel on 2000+ browsers and OS versions running on real machines. LambdaTest really helped us in reducing our web testing cost and at the same time scale it as and when required.To leverage on marketing campaigns, we needed to ensure all our deliverables render seamlessly on different mobile and desktop browsers our users use to view them from across the world. The geolocation testing functionality helped us set the location and test our website over various locations. At LambdaTest, we can now run geolocation testing to test our website across 40+ countries. The pricing plan is pretty simple and easy to grasp, with no hidden costs at all.; We needed a testing tool that was scalable enough to cover all the browsers and OS as per our clients requirement and at the same time integrate well into our workflow. Lambdatest provided us with the necessary features to meet our browser compatibility testing requirements. Without any hassle of configuring, installing or maintaining the virtual machines, we are able to launch local browser tests instantly. The best part is, Lambdatest also helps us run our Selenium based automated tests on its cloud infra - that too without burning a hole in our pocket. They offer extensive mobile and desktop browsers, thereby increasing our test coverage to maximum.; We serve a variety of clients across industries, thus we need to make sure our website is accessible from every desktop, mobile browser combination they use. Responsive web design is an integral part of our testing process. As a B2B, you want to make sure that your services are always a step ahead of your customers. And to achieve that, it's important to have a tool that keeps your code and web designing process in sync with the Production.LambdaTest's variety of browsers and local testing capabilities made it a perfect fit for our requirements. Additionally we got free access to LT Browser which is absolutely loved by our developers. We are now in a better position while tackling misbehaving websites with the help of it’s inbuilt dev tools. The best part is that LambdaTest offers an automated parallel testing that helped us achieve faster and wider test coverage over multiple browsers. Its affordable price and fast technical support made the purchase decision very easy for the team. And yes I absolutely love their support staff. They are truly available for 24*7.; While we develop our web applications, our top concern was to verify the unintentional changes to the application's visuals. We need to make sure that changing one component doesn't break the styling of another component. LambdaTest's Smart testing helped us to identify visual regression bugs for every new build. We could capture our website screenshots belonging to different environments i.e stage and production & upload them on the LambdaTest Visual Testing platform. We were able to discover visual deviations with pixel to pixel comparison by capturing screenshots, comparing them against the baseline image, and highlighting visual changes. The slider mode is very helpful to compare the visual discrepancies between the two images by toggling them. Overall, Smart testing helped us perform reliable visual testing at scale and eliminated the risk of delivering visual bugs."
Serverspace,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2019,"First of all I would like to thank Serverspace for this great platform! Out of other VPS services, this is my favorite, it offers me the flexibility to enhance my skills as a Full-Stack Developer as well as a server administrator. Well out of frustrations from other VPS services, since they have a lot of hassle to work on, this platform enabled me to easily pick my choice, add new memory capability just by a few clicks. I observed the great UI/UX of this platform, and I am planning to use this forever until this platform is still working.; I tried many cloud server providers like AWS, Azure, Google cloud and more but they didn't satisfy my needs but when I tried Serverspace I was shocked because of their server prices, for a startup that will be the best option, I saw that the price is low but the service is best as expensive, I am fully satisfied with this. I recommend Serverspace for startups once a time you see, a cybercriminal attacked my server in serverspace but... the company has reported me on time, so I saved my server from further attacks, Serverspace saved a lot of time and money.; What I like about this company is the many options offered to us customers since I'm a Windows/Linux User and most of my needs rely on multi-OS systems. That's why I run 4 servers with ServerSpace. Their Windows Machines are as good as you can imagine, they offer all the alternatives I need, and I also run servers with CentOS. With Serverspace, I can cover all my needs for my business, and the best part is I also have different options on the payment side. They only charge me for the current use and not a whole monthly amount in advance, and I can cancel any server I ordered at any second. Also, their support tickets get answered right away. It's pretty good. What I think they could do better is improve their automatic system detecting payments with Ever. Every time I pay with Ever, I have to send a support ticket with transaction ID and all info about the payment to add funds. I get a reply the same day, but I'd rather not have to notify it. I'm very happy with this service, and I'll; I tried six to seven cloud services before I settled with Serverspace. I am glad that I found it. All I need was a reliable, scalable, economical, and user-friendly server for my data crunching and web application. First, their pricing is way attractive. The bigger sites may start with some low teaser rates or even free credits, but their prices go up exponentially with more CPU and memory. Serverspace's pricing remains very reasonable. Granted they don't offer super big servers, I don't need them either. The other thing I like is that they charge significantly less when you turn off the server while other sites charge you the same. I like their simple offers; simple servers that let me build my own environments. The plethora of bells and whistles elsewhere turn me off. Their servers are generally reliable except they failed to turn on a couple of times. But they fixed it promptly and were responsive through the process. Their clean and intuitive web UI is helpful.; I work most of the time but I also trade forex to make some extra money. Since I am not always at home, I had to get an expert advisor for my trades and that was when I started looking for a reliable VPS service. I have been using Serverspace VPS for less than a year now and I can say it has been a peaceful experience in the sense that I never had to worry about shutting down of the server. It's very pocket-friendly and I like that I can pay daily as I use it. What I enjoy most is the option to shutdown a server without deleting or destroying it completely, that way I can restart the server when I need it and continue using it. Like I said, you only get charged for what you use. For a little fee, you also have the option to increase the size or speed of a VPS server if your work becomes bigger without having to get a new server. I can only hope to get more than 50 Mbps speed for the fixed plan as it takes more time to work when everything is so slow.; I have been using Serverspace for about 6 months now. System performance is good. I have never used a VPS before, so I need some help getting up and running. Support always answers back thru a support ticket, although you may have to wait up to 6 hours sometimes, the support is good. Their pricing has been great, and I plan to stay with the service.; Before I decided to use their servers to host our services, I checked out and tried many alternatives. Some time ago I found Serverspace at some offers comparer and I decided to give it a try and I'm really satisfied. There are no problems with servers which I met using servers from others. So at the moment, I think I will use Serverspace servers for my other projects and initiatives.; I like Serverspace! The relation between the purchase price and the performance is perfect. I like dealing with you because of the cheap prices and high performance. Also, the support team is fast, I always get my tickets resolved as fast as possible. The deployment of services is also fast. In general, I do have a good experience and would like to build a long-term relationship.; The uptime and the speed of the service are fantastic. The quality of support is second to none. Every time I need help, I get a very personalized answer and they always go the extra mile to solve my problem. I have tried many competitors in the past but none of them come close to the quality of service I am getting in Serverspace."

Tudip Technologies Pvt. Ltd.,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2010,"I have been working with Tudip on several projects and what distinguishes a good QA team from Tudip is their consistency, the ability to have great judgement and the attention to detail. They are eager to find what we missed the same ay when they see it for the first time than the 1000th time. They never assume they always double check. Also from a cultural point of view, they have been amazing adapting on how we do things, always there when we need them (Weekends, late night, even during major Indian holidays) and very supportive when things look impossible.; Working with Tudip was a great experience. After working with two other US based development companies and having bad experiences I was a little hesitant. But my worries were put at easy after the first 2 week sprint and I saw how fast they were making progress. My project was eventually completed on time despite issues with secondary API organizations we needed to work with. And even through that whole process Tudip handled it all. Net, anytime I need development work done they are the first company I will go with.; ; ; I've been working with Tudip now for over 2 years and our relationship has continued to grow as we've also grown. They've been able to scale with our team and provide a very high level of service. As the CEO its nice to know that you have an amazing team such as Tudip Technologies and Dipti the CEO, to support our mission. We foresee a continued growing relationship with Dipti's team for many years to come! Remember, ""Life is better with an Amigo""! :); INVESTA is our second large project with Tudip. We have entrusted them several aspects of the Back end due to the sensitive nature of the information that is being handled.They have proven over time a dedication and passion to the project second to none.We are currently working and will carry on with them for the years to come.; Very Professional Customer Services plus very polite and I happy to talk with the nice lady whoever she maybe."

They really got involved in the project and went the extra mile to deliver a product beyond our expectations. Over the years we realized that those first years working with them set the foundation from where we were able to build the rest of our products. We sincerely recommend them to any company or individual who is seeking to create great digital products or services as they really know how to translate ideas into digital products.; Zarego's team and PM are very experienced and friendly. They are always responsive to changing needs and have a great approach to building startup applications. Being off-shore/near-shore they are very responsive and reliable and feel like they are right there with you every step of the way. I highly recommend them.; I worked with Zarego to develop a mobile app. They were always knowledgeable and responsive. The communication throughout the whole project went smoothly and the team shipped the code on time. I would be happy to work with them again.; Had a great experience working with Zarego, I was very happy with the final product they delivered and with a great process.; We needed a mobile app for one of our solutions and Zarego responded promptly with great product quality."
LambdaTest,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2017,"Being a developer, responsive testing comes as a part of the package, every time I develop a webpage. I have been relying over LambdaTest for responsive testing. They have a feature which allows me to capture full page screenshots of my webpages in scores of different devices. I could even capture web pages that are locally hosted. And now, they have come up with a browser that lets me not only capture screenshots but interact with my websites in 25+ different devices, in a side by side view. That allows me to test my website responsiveness on a bunch of devices in a live-interactive manner. I must admit I am highly impressed by the LT browser and I am a tough guy to impress.; We use LambdaTest across our development & testing team. Our developers always perform cross browser tests on their local pages across different browsers and their versions before sending them to the testers. The integrations with 3rd party tools make it more useful. It provides a full development environment that looks very close to the real thing.Before we started using LambdaTest, we're limited to the browsers and their versions that are available on our desktops and laptops. But now with LambdaTest, we are using Selenium grid of 2000+ browsers and their versions available on the platform.If you want a solution to replace testing infrastructure that is hard to main and look after, LambdaTest is the best solution according to us.; Have been using Lambdatest for around 1 year now, and could say that it’s a useful testing tool for our team. Offering great combinations of browsers and operating systems for you to test on and most importantly there are many types of additional logs that come with each test which helps in debugging.. Glad to see the integration with Travis CI due to which we could optimally use this tool with our CI CD pipelines directly. We were able to effectively run TestNG and Selenium tests using their documentation and as an added advantage their support team is quick and helpful.; The industry we function (e-commerce) has a broad category of audience. We need to make sure our website is accessible to everyone irrespective of the browser / operating system they use. Ofcourse, responsive web design check is a major bullet point over our testing checklist as well. As a B2C, it's crucial for us to stay ahead of the customers and we wanted a solution which could help us ensure our changes would work seamlessly when shipped to the Production. LambdaTest made a great fit here when considered the latest browsers on the product, ability to test local pages along with a complimentary access to LT browser which is an absolute delight for our developers and testers. It helps us save a considerable effort on responsive testing plus the native developer tools allow us to dig deep into any UI mismatch! Also As mentioned we could achieve wider test coverage in time by running multiple combinations of browsers in parallel with LambdaTest automation suite. Our director to purchase the subscription was due to their affordable pricing for the parallel tests and the communication from the support team!; Running tests serially can be a good option when your product is at an early stage. But as we scaled the product, we needed a tool to reduce test time execution and pace up our test cycles. LambdaTest simplified the Selenium testing experience for us with their cloud based platform which allowed us to execute our test cases in parallel on hundreds of browsers. We could easily automate the test cases, get the sessions recorded and share the test reports across the team for assessment using Asana integration. We even leverage the integration with CircleCI to run automated tests on LambdaTest through our pipeline. The CircleCI Orb is handy for testing our privately hosted application.It’s good to see now that using LambdaTest we could run multiple tests on multiple VM’s, saving us hours of testing time and maintenance cost of local infrastructure. Personally, one thing that LambdaTest does very well is continuing to provide tutorials for testing, so that we stay up to speed and are even able to learn new things.I definitely saw myself applying a lot of the new concepts that I learned from their blogs.; As technology advances, enterprises are switching from manual testing to Selenium Test Automation. But one area most enterprises are still struggling is with the scalability of running several tests in parallel. LambdaTest has been a boon for us when it comes to Selenium automation. With a Selenium Grid based on the cloud, we don't need to stress about setting up and maintaining infrastructure anymore. We can run hundreds of tests in parallel on 2000+ browsers and OS versions running on real machines. LambdaTest really helped us in reducing our web testing cost and at the same time scale it as and when required.To leverage on marketing campaigns, we needed to ensure all our deliverables render seamlessly on different mobile and desktop browsers our users use to view them from across the world. The geolocation testing functionality helped us set the location and test our website over various locations. At LambdaTest, we can now run geolocation testing to test our website across 40+ countries. The pricing plan is pretty simple and easy to grasp, with no hidden costs at all.; We needed a testing tool that was scalable enough to cover all the browsers and OS as per our clients requirement and at the same time integrate well into our workflow. Lambdatest provided us with the necessary features to meet our browser compatibility testing requirements. Without any hassle of configuring, installing or maintaining the virtual machines, we are able to launch local browser tests instantly. The best part is, Lambdatest also helps us run our Selenium based automated tests on its cloud infra - that too without burning a hole in our pocket. They offer extensive mobile and desktop browsers, thereby increasing our test coverage to maximum.; We serve a variety of clients across industries, thus we need to make sure our website is accessible from every desktop, mobile browser combination they use. Responsive web design is an integral part of our testing process. As a B2B, you want to make sure that your services are always a step ahead of your customers. And to achieve that, it's important to have a tool that keeps your code and web designing process in sync with the Production.LambdaTest's variety of browsers and local testing capabilities made it a perfect fit for our requirements. Additionally we got free access to LT Browser which is absolutely loved by our developers. We are now in a better position while tackling misbehaving websites with the help of it’s inbuilt dev tools. The best part is that LambdaTest offers an automated parallel testing that helped us achieve faster and wider test coverage over multiple browsers. Its affordable price and fast technical support made the purchase decision very easy for the team. And yes I absolutely love their support staff. They are truly available for 24*7.; While we develop our web applications, our top concern was to verify the unintentional changes to the application's visuals. We need to make sure that changing one component doesn't break the styling of another component. LambdaTest's Smart testing helped us to identify visual regression bugs for every new build. We could capture our website screenshots belonging to different environments i.e stage and production & upload them on the LambdaTest Visual Testing platform. We were able to discover visual deviations with pixel to pixel comparison by capturing screenshots, comparing them against the baseline image, and highlighting visual changes. The slider mode is very helpful to compare the visual discrepancies between the two images by toggling them. Overall, Smart testing helped us perform reliable visual testing at scale and eliminated the risk of delivering visual bugs."
Serverspace,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2019,"First of all I would like to thank Serverspace for this great platform! Out of other VPS services, this is my favorite, it offers me the flexibility to enhance my skills as a Full-Stack Developer as well as a server administrator. Well out of frustrations from other VPS services, since they have a lot of hassle to work on, this platform enabled me to easily pick my choice, add new memory capability just by a few clicks. I observed the great UI/UX of this platform, and I am planning to use this forever until this platform is still working.; I tried many cloud server providers like AWS, Azure, Google cloud and more but they didn't satisfy my needs but when I tried Serverspace I was shocked because of their server prices, for a startup that will be the best option, I saw that the price is low but the service is best as expensive, I am fully satisfied with this. I recommend Serverspace for startups once a time you see, a cybercriminal attacked my server in serverspace but... the company has reported me on time, so I saved my server from further attacks, Serverspace saved a lot of time and money.; What I like about this company is the many options offered to us customers since I'm a Windows/Linux User and most of my needs rely on multi-OS systems. That's why I run 4 servers with ServerSpace. Their Windows Machines are as good as you can imagine, they offer all the alternatives I need, and I also run servers with CentOS. With Serverspace, I can cover all my needs for my business, and the best part is I also have different options on the payment side. They only charge me for the current use and not a whole monthly amount in advance, and I can cancel any server I ordered at any second. Also, their support tickets get answered right away. It's pretty good. What I think they could do better is improve their automatic system detecting payments with Ever. Every time I pay with Ever, I have to send a support ticket with transaction ID and all info about the payment to add funds. I get a reply the same day, but I'd rather not have to notify it. I'm very happy with this service, and I'll; I tried six to seven cloud services before I settled with Serverspace. I am glad that I found it. All I need was a reliable, scalable, economical, and user-friendly server for my data crunching and web application. First, their pricing is way attractive. The bigger sites may start with some low teaser rates or even free credits, but their prices go up exponentially with more CPU and memory. Serverspace's pricing remains very reasonable. Granted they don't offer super big servers, I don't need them either. The other thing I like is that they charge significantly less when you turn off the server while other sites charge you the same. I like their simple offers; simple servers that let me build my own environments. The plethora of bells and whistles elsewhere turn me off. Their servers are generally reliable except they failed to turn on a couple of times. But they fixed it promptly and were responsive through the process. Their clean and intuitive web UI is helpful.; I work most of the time but I also trade forex to make some extra money. Since I am not always at home, I had to get an expert advisor for my trades and that was when I started looking for a reliable VPS service. I have been using Serverspace VPS for less than a year now and I can say it has been a peaceful experience in the sense that I never had to worry about shutting down of the server. It's very pocket-friendly and I like that I can pay daily as I use it. What I enjoy most is the option to shutdown a server without deleting or destroying it completely, that way I can restart the server when I need it and continue using it. Like I said, you only get charged for what you use. For a little fee, you also have the option to increase the size or speed of a VPS server if your work becomes bigger without having to get a new server. I can only hope to get more than 50 Mbps speed for the fixed plan as it takes more time to work when everything is so slow.; I have been using Serverspace for about 6 months now. System performance is good. I have never used a VPS before, so I need some help getting up and running. Support always answers back thru a support ticket, although you may have to wait up to 6 hours sometimes, the support is good. Their pricing has been great, and I plan to stay with the service.; Before I decided to use their servers to host our services, I checked out and tried many alternatives. Some time ago I found Serverspace at some offers comparer and I decided to give it a try and I'm really satisfied. There are no problems with servers which I met using servers from others. So at the moment, I think I will use Serverspace servers for my other projects and initiatives.; I like Serverspace! The relation between the purchase price and the performance is perfect. I like dealing with you because of the cheap prices and high performance. Also, the support team is fast, I always get my tickets resolved as fast as possible. The deployment of services is also fast. In general, I do have a good experience and would like to build a long-term relationship.; The uptime and the speed of the service are fantastic. The quality of support is second to none. Every time I need help, I get a very personalized answer and they always go the extra mile to solve my problem. I have tried many competitors in the past but none of them come close to the quality of service I am getting in Serverspace."

After interviewing multiple (8) companies, I selected Alliancetek because they were experienced, offered end to end solutions beyond a standard mobile app firm, and their price point was below competing firms.Alliancetek delivered on all promises with great professionalism. We had to pivot several times in the course of the project and each hurdle was handled without a hitch.

< $25/hr ",2010,"I have been working with Tudip on several projects and what distinguishes a good QA team from Tudip is their consistency, the ability to have great judgement and the attention to detail. They are eager to find what we missed the same ay when they see it for the first time than the 1000th time. They never assume they always double check. Also from a cultural point of view, they have been amazing adapting on how we do things, always there when we need them (Weekends, late night, even during major Indian holidays) and very supportive when things look impossible.; Working with Tudip was a great experience. After working with two other US based development companies and having bad experiences I was a little hesitant. But my worries were put at easy after the first 2 week sprint and I saw how fast they were making progress. My project was eventually completed on time despite issues with secondary API organizations we needed to work with. And even through that whole process Tudip handled it all. Net, anytime I need development work done they are the first company I will go with.; ; ; I've been working with Tudip now for over 2 years and our relationship has continued to grow as we've also grown. They've been able to scale with our team and provide a very high level of service. As the CEO its nice to know that you have an amazing team such as Tudip Technologies and Dipti the CEO, to support our mission. We foresee a continued growing relationship with Dipti's team for many years to come! Remember, ""Life is better with an Amigo""! :); INVESTA is our second large project with Tudip. We have entrusted them several aspects of the Back end due to the sensitive nature of the information that is being handled.They have proven over time a dedication and passion to the project second to none.We are currently working and will carry on with them for the years to come.; Very Professional Customer Services plus very polite and I happy to talk with the nice lady whoever she maybe."

They really got involved in the project and went the extra mile to deliver a product beyond our expectations.

LambdaTest,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2017,"Being a developer, responsive testing comes as a part of the package, every time I develop a webpage. I have been relying over LambdaTest for responsive testing. They have a feature which allows me to capture full page screenshots of my webpages in scores of different devices. I could even capture web pages that are locally hosted. And now, they have come up with a browser that lets me not only capture screenshots but interact with my websites in 25+ different devices, in a side by side view. That allows me to test my website responsiveness on a bunch of devices in a live-interactive manner. I must admit I am highly impressed by the LT browser and I am a tough guy to impress.; We use LambdaTest across our development & testing team. Our developers always perform cross browser tests on their local pages across different browsers and their versions before sending them to the testers. The integrations with 3rd party tools make it more useful. It provides a full development environment that looks very close to the real thing.Before we started using LambdaTest, we're limited to the browsers and their versions that are available on our desktops and laptops. But now with LambdaTest, we are using Selenium grid of 2000+ browsers and their versions available on the platform.If you want a solution to replace testing infrastructure that is hard to main and look after, LambdaTest is the best solution according to us.; Have been using Lambdatest for around 1 year now, and could say that it’s a useful testing tool for our team. Offering great combinations of browsers and operating systems for you to test on and most importantly there are many types of additional logs that come with each test which helps in debugging.. Glad to see the integration with Travis CI due to which we could optimally use this tool with our CI CD pipelines directly. We were able to effectively run TestNG and Selenium tests using their documentation and as an added advantage their support team is quick and helpful.; The industry we function (e-commerce) has a broad category of audience. We need to make sure our website is accessible to everyone irrespective of the browser / operating system they use. Ofcourse, responsive web design check is a major bullet point over our testing checklist as well. As a B2C, it's crucial for us to stay ahead of the customers and we wanted a solution which could help us ensure our changes would work seamlessly when shipped to the Production. LambdaTest made a great fit here when considered the latest browsers on the product, ability to test local pages along with a complimentary access to LT browser which is an absolute delight for our developers and testers. It helps us save a considerable effort on responsive testing plus the native developer tools allow us to dig deep into any UI mismatch! Also As mentioned we could achieve wider test coverage in time by running multiple combinations of browsers in parallel with LambdaTest automation suite. Our director to purchase the subscription was due to their affordable pricing for the parallel tests and the communication from the support team!; Running tests serially can be a good option when your product is at an early stage. But as we scaled the product, we needed a tool to reduce test time execution and pace up our test cycles. LambdaTest simplified the Selenium testing experience for us with their cloud based platform which allowed us to execute our test cases in parallel on hundreds of browsers. We could easily automate the test cases, get the sessions recorded and share the test reports across the team for assessment using Asana integration. We even leverage the integration with CircleCI to run automated tests on LambdaTest through our pipeline. The CircleCI Orb is handy for testing our privately hosted application.It’s good to see now that using LambdaTest we could run multiple tests on multiple VM’s, saving us hours of testing time and maintenance cost of local infrastructure. Personally, one thing that LambdaTest does very well is continuing to provide tutorials for testing, so that we stay up to speed and are even able to learn new things.I definitely saw myself applying a lot of the new concepts that I learned from their blogs.; As technology advances, enterprises are switching from manual testing to Selenium Test Automation. But one area most enterprises are still struggling is with the scalability of running several tests in parallel. LambdaTest has been a boon for us when it comes to Selenium automation. With a Selenium Grid based on the cloud, we don't need to stress about setting up and maintaining infrastructure anymore. We can run hundreds of tests in parallel on 2000+ browsers and OS versions running on real machines. LambdaTest really helped us in reducing our web testing cost and at the same time scale it as and when required.To leverage on marketing campaigns, we needed to ensure all our deliverables render seamlessly on different mobile and desktop browsers our users use to view them from across the world. The geolocation testing functionality helped us set the location and test our website over various locations. At LambdaTest, we can now run geolocation testing to test our website across 40+ countries. The pricing plan is pretty simple and easy to grasp, with no hidden costs at all.; We needed a testing tool that was scalable enough to cover all the browsers and OS as per our clients requirement and at the same time integrate well into our workflow. Lambdatest provided us with the necessary features to meet our browser compatibility testing requirements. Without any hassle of configuring, installing or maintaining the virtual machines, we are able to launch local browser tests instantly. The best part is, Lambdatest also helps us run our Selenium based automated tests on its cloud infra - that too without burning a hole in our pocket. They offer extensive mobile and desktop browsers, thereby increasing our test coverage to maximum.; We serve a variety of clients across industries, thus we need to make sure our website is accessible from every desktop, mobile browser combination they use. Responsive web design is an integral part of our testing process. As a B2B, you want to make sure that your services are always a step ahead of your customers. And to achieve that, it's important to have a tool that keeps your code and web designing process in sync with the Production.LambdaTest's variety of browsers and local testing capabilities made it a perfect fit for our requirements. Additionally we got free access to LT Browser which is absolutely loved by our developers. We are now in a better position while tackling misbehaving websites with the help of it’s inbuilt dev tools. The best part is that LambdaTest offers an automated parallel testing that helped us achieve faster and wider test coverage over multiple browsers. Its affordable price and fast technical support made the purchase decision very easy for the team. And yes I absolutely love their support staff. They are truly available for 24*7.; While we develop our web applications, our top concern was to verify the unintentional changes to the application's visuals. We need to make sure that changing one component doesn't break the styling of another component. LambdaTest's Smart testing helped us to identify visual regression bugs for every new build. We could capture our website screenshots belonging to different environments i.e stage and production & upload them on the LambdaTest Visual Testing platform. We were able to discover visual deviations with pixel to pixel comparison by capturing screenshots, comparing them against the baseline image, and highlighting visual changes. The slider mode is very helpful to compare the visual discrepancies between the two images by toggling them. Overall, Smart testing helped us perform reliable visual testing at scale and eliminated the risk of delivering visual bugs."
Serverspace,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2019,"First of all I would like to thank Serverspace for this great platform! Out of other VPS services, this is my favorite, it offers me the flexibility to enhance my skills as a Full-Stack Developer as well as a server administrator. Well out of frustrations from other VPS services, since they have a lot of hassle to work on, this platform enabled me to easily pick my choice, add new memory capability just by a few clicks. I observed the great UI/UX of this platform, and I am planning to use this forever until this platform is still working.; I tried many cloud server providers like AWS, Azure, Google cloud and more but they didn't satisfy my needs but when I tried Serverspace I was shocked because of their server prices, for a startup that will be the best option, I saw that the price is low but the service is best as expensive, I am fully satisfied with this. I recommend Serverspace for startups once a time you see, a cybercriminal attacked my server in serverspace but... the company has reported me on time, so I saved my server from further attacks, Serverspace saved a lot of time and money.; What I like about this company is the many options offered to us customers since I'm a Windows/Linux User and most of my needs rely on multi-OS systems. That's why I run 4 servers with ServerSpace. Their Windows Machines are as good as you can imagine, they offer all the alternatives I need, and I also run servers with CentOS. With Serverspace, I can cover all my needs for my business, and the best part is I also have different options on the payment side. They only charge me for the current use and not a whole monthly amount in advance, and I can cancel any server I ordered at any second. Also, their support tickets get answered right away. It's pretty good. What I think they could do better is improve their automatic system detecting payments with Ever. Every time I pay with Ever, I have to send a support ticket with transaction ID and all info about the payment to add funds. I get a reply the same day, but I'd rather not have to notify it. I'm very happy with this service, and I'll; I tried six to seven cloud services before I settled with Serverspace. I am glad that I found it. All I need was a reliable, scalable, economical, and user-friendly server for my data crunching and web application. First, their pricing is way attractive. The bigger sites may start with some low teaser rates or even free credits, but their prices go up exponentially with more CPU and memory. Serverspace's pricing remains very reasonable. Granted they don't offer super big servers, I don't need them either. The other thing I like is that they charge significantly less when you turn off the server while other sites charge you the same. I like their simple offers; simple servers that let me build my own environments. The plethora of bells and whistles elsewhere turn me off. Their servers are generally reliable except they failed to turn on a couple of times. But they fixed it promptly and were responsive through the process. Their clean and intuitive web UI is helpful.; I work most of the time but I also trade forex to make some extra money. Since I am not always at home, I had to get an expert advisor for my trades and that was when I started looking for a reliable VPS service. I have been using Serverspace VPS for less than a year now and I can say it has been a peaceful experience in the sense that I never had to worry about shutting down of the server. It's very pocket-friendly and I like that I can pay daily as I use it. What I enjoy most is the option to shutdown a server without deleting or destroying it completely, that way I can restart the server when I need it and continue using it. Like I said, you only get charged for what you use. For a little fee, you also have the option to increase the size or speed of a VPS server if your work becomes bigger without having to get a new server. I can only hope to get more than 50 Mbps speed for the fixed plan as it takes more time to work when everything is so slow.; I have been using Serverspace for about 6 months now. System performance is good. I have never used a VPS before, so I need some help getting up and running. Support always answers back thru a support ticket, although you may have to wait up to 6 hours sometimes, the support is good. Their pricing has been great, and I plan to stay with the service.; Before I decided to use their servers to host our services, I checked out and tried many alternatives. Some time ago I found Serverspace at some offers comparer and I decided to give it a try and I'm really satisfied. There are no problems with servers which I met using servers from others. So at the moment, I think I will use Serverspace servers for my other projects and initiatives.; I like Serverspace! The relation between the purchase price and the performance is perfect. I like dealing with you because of the cheap prices and high performance. Also, the support team is fast, I always get my tickets resolved as fast as possible. The deployment of services is also fast. In general, I do have a good experience and would like to build a long-term relationship.; The uptime and the speed of the service are fantastic. The quality of support is second to none. Every time I need help, I get a very personalized answer and they always go the extra mile to solve my problem. I have tried many competitors in the past but none of them come close to the quality of service I am getting in Serverspace."

After interviewing multiple (8) companies, I selected Alliancetek because they were experienced, offered end to end solutions beyond a standard mobile app firm, and their price point was below competing firms.Alliancetek delivered on all promises with great professionalism. We had to pivot several times in the course of the project and each hurdle was handled without a hitch. My “team” consisted of 3 Alliancetek employees (1 project manager, 1 iOS developer, 1 Android developer) who I spoke with weekly through Microsoft Team meetings. There were additional back end developers who worked on the project.

Working together hand-in-hand, we developed a site tailored to the needs of our clients. Since development of the site, we've had clients ask for increased personalization and customization, and AllianceTek has been able to help us develop these in an expedient and efficient manner. Another bonus is that even after several years of working together, we've had the same points of contact throughout. This has been an invaluable part of us working together so well. After the past few years of working together, I couldn't recommend AllianceTek highly enough.; ; AllianceTek has delivered outstanding products and services which has helped Strategas achieve outstanding recognition from our financial services clients. Beyond those technical achievements, what sets this team apart from the crowd is the rapid responsiveness to my requests, be it a production problem, coding change, or business challenge; that kind of responsiveness is an exceptional work ethic not frequently seen in our industry and highly valued by my firm. I can always count upon this team to respond in kind with their best efforts.; ; "
Tudip Technologies Pvt. Ltd.,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2010,"I have been working with Tudip on several projects and what distinguishes a good QA team from Tudip is their consistency, the ability to have great judgement and the attention to detail.

Also from a cultural point of view, they have been amazing adapting on how we do things, always there when we need them (Weekends, late night, even during major Indian holidays) and very supportive when things look impossible.; Working with Tudip was a great experience. After working with two other US based development companies and having bad experiences I was a little hesitant. But my worries were put at easy after the first 2 week sprint and I saw how fast they were making progress. My project was eventually completed on time despite issues with secondary API organizations we needed to work with. And even through that whole process Tudip handled it all. Net, anytime I need development work done they are the first company I will go with.; ; ; I've been working with Tudip now for over 2 years and our relationship has continued to grow as we've also grown.

LambdaTest,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2017,"Being a developer, responsive testing comes as a part of the package, every time I develop a webpage. I have been relying over LambdaTest for responsive testing. They have a feature which allows me to capture full page screenshots of my webpages in scores of different devices. I could even capture web pages that are locally hosted. And now, they have come up with a browser that lets me not only capture screenshots but interact with my websites in 25+ different devices, in a side by side view. That allows me to test my website responsiveness on a bunch of devices in a live-interactive manner. I must admit I am highly impressed by the LT browser and I am a tough guy to impress.; We use LambdaTest across our development & testing team. Our developers always perform cross browser tests on their local pages across different browsers and their versions before sending them to the testers. The integrations with 3rd party tools make it more useful. It provides a full development environment that looks very close to the real thing.Before we started using LambdaTest, we're limited to the browsers and their versions that are available on our desktops and laptops. But now with LambdaTest, we are using Selenium grid of 2000+ browsers and their versions available on the platform.If you want a solution to replace testing infrastructure that is hard to main and look after, LambdaTest is the best solution according to us.; Have been using Lambdatest for around 1 year now, and could say that it’s a useful testing tool for our team. Offering great combinations of browsers and operating systems for you to test on and most importantly there are many types of additional logs that come with each test which helps in debugging.. Glad to see the integration with Travis CI due to which we could optimally use this tool with our CI CD pipelines directly. We were able to effectively run TestNG and Selenium tests using their documentation and as an added advantage their support team is quick and helpful.; The industry we function (e-commerce) has a broad category of audience. We need to make sure our website is accessible to everyone irrespective of the browser / operating system they use. Ofcourse, responsive web design check is a major bullet point over our testing checklist as well. As a B2C, it's crucial for us to stay ahead of the customers and we wanted a solution which could help us ensure our changes would work seamlessly when shipped to the Production. LambdaTest made a great fit here when considered the latest browsers on the product, ability to test local pages along with a complimentary access to LT browser which is an absolute delight for our developers and testers. It helps us save a considerable effort on responsive testing plus the native developer tools allow us to dig deep into any UI mismatch! Also As mentioned we could achieve wider test coverage in time by running multiple combinations of browsers in parallel with LambdaTest automation suite. Our director to purchase the subscription was due to their affordable pricing for the parallel tests and the communication from the support team!; Running tests serially can be a good option when your product is at an early stage. But as we scaled the product, we needed a tool to reduce test time execution and pace up our test cycles. LambdaTest simplified the Selenium testing experience for us with their cloud based platform which allowed us to execute our test cases in parallel on hundreds of browsers. We could easily automate the test cases, get the sessions recorded and share the test reports across the team for assessment using Asana integration. We even leverage the integration with CircleCI to run automated tests on LambdaTest through our pipeline. The CircleCI Orb is handy for testing our privately hosted application.It’s good to see now that using LambdaTest we could run multiple tests on multiple VM’s, saving us hours of testing time and maintenance cost of local infrastructure. Personally, one thing that LambdaTest does very well is continuing to provide tutorials for testing, so that we stay up to speed and are even able to learn new things.I definitely saw myself applying a lot of the new concepts that I learned from their blogs.; As technology advances, enterprises are switching from manual testing to Selenium Test Automation. But one area most enterprises are still struggling is with the scalability of running several tests in parallel. LambdaTest has been a boon for us when it comes to Selenium automation. With a Selenium Grid based on the cloud, we don't need to stress about setting up and maintaining infrastructure anymore. We can run hundreds of tests in parallel on 2000+ browsers and OS versions running on real machines. LambdaTest really helped us in reducing our web testing cost and at the same time scale it as and when required.To leverage on marketing campaigns, we needed to ensure all our deliverables render seamlessly on different mobile and desktop browsers our users use to view them from across the world. The geolocation testing functionality helped us set the location and test our website over various locations. At LambdaTest, we can now run geolocation testing to test our website across 40+ countries. The pricing plan is pretty simple and easy to grasp, with no hidden costs at all.; We needed a testing tool that was scalable enough to cover all the browsers and OS as per our clients requirement and at the same time integrate well into our workflow. Lambdatest provided us with the necessary features to meet our browser compatibility testing requirements. Without any hassle of configuring, installing or maintaining the virtual machines, we are able to launch local browser tests instantly. The best part is, Lambdatest also helps us run our Selenium based automated tests on its cloud infra - that too without burning a hole in our pocket. They offer extensive mobile and desktop browsers, thereby increasing our test coverage to maximum.; We serve a variety of clients across industries, thus we need to make sure our website is accessible from every desktop, mobile browser combination they use. Responsive web design is an integral part of our testing process. As a B2B, you want to make sure that your services are always a step ahead of your customers. And to achieve that, it's important to have a tool that keeps your code and web designing process in sync with the Production.LambdaTest's variety of browsers and local testing capabilities made it a perfect fit for our requirements. Additionally we got free access to LT Browser which is absolutely loved by our developers. We are now in a better position while tackling misbehaving websites with the help of it’s inbuilt dev tools. The best part is that LambdaTest offers an automated parallel testing that helped us achieve faster and wider test coverage over multiple browsers. Its affordable price and fast technical support made the purchase decision very easy for the team. And yes I absolutely love their support staff. They are truly available for 24*7.; While we develop our web applications, our top concern was to verify the unintentional changes to the application's visuals. We need to make sure that changing one component doesn't break the styling of another component. LambdaTest's Smart testing helped us to identify visual regression bugs for every new build. We could capture our website screenshots belonging to different environments i.e stage and production & upload them on the LambdaTest Visual Testing platform. We were able to discover visual deviations with pixel to pixel comparison by capturing screenshots, comparing them against the baseline image, and highlighting visual changes. The slider mode is very helpful to compare the visual discrepancies between the two images by toggling them. Overall, Smart testing helped us perform reliable visual testing at scale and eliminated the risk of delivering visual bugs."
Serverspace,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2019,"First of all I would like to thank Serverspace for this great platform! Out of other VPS services, this is my favorite, it offers me the flexibility to enhance my skills as a Full-Stack Developer as well as a server administrator. Well out of frustrations from other VPS services, since they have a lot of hassle to work on, this platform enabled me to easily pick my choice, add new memory capability just by a few clicks. I observed the great UI/UX of this platform, and I am planning to use this forever until this platform is still working.; I tried many cloud server providers like AWS, Azure, Google cloud and more but they didn't satisfy my needs but when I tried Serverspace I was shocked because of their server prices, for a startup that will be the best option, I saw that the price is low but the service is best as expensive, I am fully satisfied with this. I recommend Serverspace for startups once a time you see, a cybercriminal attacked my server in serverspace but... the company has reported me on time, so I saved my server from further attacks, Serverspace saved a lot of time and money.; What I like about this company is the many options offered to us customers since I'm a Windows/Linux User and most of my needs rely on multi-OS systems. That's why I run 4 servers with ServerSpace. Their Windows Machines are as good as you can imagine, they offer all the alternatives I need, and I also run servers with CentOS. With Serverspace, I can cover all my needs for my business, and the best part is I also have different options on the payment side. They only charge me for the current use and not a whole monthly amount in advance, and I can cancel any server I ordered at any second. Also, their support tickets get answered right away. It's pretty good. What I think they could do better is improve their automatic system detecting payments with Ever. Every time I pay with Ever, I have to send a support ticket with transaction ID and all info about the payment to add funds. I get a reply the same day, but I'd rather not have to notify it. I'm very happy with this service, and I'll; I tried six to seven cloud services before I settled with Serverspace. I am glad that I found it. All I need was a reliable, scalable, economical, and user-friendly server for my data crunching and web application. First, their pricing is way attractive. The bigger sites may start with some low teaser rates or even free credits, but their prices go up exponentially with more CPU and memory. Serverspace's pricing remains very reasonable. Granted they don't offer super big servers, I don't need them either. The other thing I like is that they charge significantly less when you turn off the server while other sites charge you the same. I like their simple offers; simple servers that let me build my own environments. The plethora of bells and whistles elsewhere turn me off. Their servers are generally reliable except they failed to turn on a couple of times. But they fixed it promptly and were responsive through the process. Their clean and intuitive web UI is helpful.; I work most of the time but I also trade forex to make some extra money. Since I am not always at home, I had to get an expert advisor for my trades and that was when I started looking for a reliable VPS service. I have been using Serverspace VPS for less than a year now and I can say it has been a peaceful experience in the sense that I never had to worry about shutting down of the server. It's very pocket-friendly and I like that I can pay daily as I use it. What I enjoy most is the option to shutdown a server without deleting or destroying it completely, that way I can restart the server when I need it and continue using it. Like I said, you only get charged for what you use. For a little fee, you also have the option to increase the size or speed of a VPS server if your work becomes bigger without having to get a new server. I can only hope to get more than 50 Mbps speed for the fixed plan as it takes more time to work when everything is so slow.; I have been using Serverspace for about 6 months now. System performance is good. I have never used a VPS before, so I need some help getting up and running. Support always answers back thru a support ticket, although you may have to wait up to 6 hours sometimes, the support is good. Their pricing has been great, and I plan to stay with the service.; Before I decided to use their servers to host our services, I checked out and tried many alternatives. Some time ago I found Serverspace at some offers comparer and I decided to give it a try and I'm really satisfied. There are no problems with servers which I met using servers from others. So at the moment, I think I will use Serverspace servers for my other projects and initiatives.; I like Serverspace! The relation between the purchase price and the performance is perfect. I like dealing with you because of the cheap prices and high performance. Also, the support team is fast, I always get my tickets resolved as fast as possible. The deployment of services is also fast. In general, I do have a good experience and would like to build a long-term relationship.; The uptime and the speed of the service are fantastic. The quality of support is second to none. Every time I need help, I get a very personalized answer and they always go the extra mile to solve my problem. I have tried many competitors in the past but none of them come close to the quality of service I am getting in Serverspace."

Without their tremendous work, we would not have been able to get over the line and give our customers a product that would be helpful to them. AllianceTek were honestly a game changer, and I could not imagine being where we are today as a company without their heavy and continued involvement.; The project has moved extremely smooth. The communication, the Dev team, I mean all of you guys over at Alliance Tech have just blown away my expectations and I can't thank you guys enough for helping me bring this idea into a reality. This is going to, not just revolutionise the industry, but revolutionise sales training in general. it's going to be able to present different scenarios, to the training platform getting feedback and uploading their videos to train to where we can train hundreds of people at the same time. I mean guys, this software that you guys have helped bring to life is truly going to change the industry.; Sokolis Group has been working with AllianceTek for almost a decade. We partnered with them to design and build a proprietary application that is critical to our business for analyzing and reporting our clients' fuel transaction data. Over the years, we have continued to work with AllianceTek to develop new features which helped make our business more efficient and our reporting to clients more insightful. In addition, AllianceTek provides the hosting and maintenance for this cloud-based application and we trust them to handle this important responsibility. They are a valued partner to our business and I would not hesitate to recommend them.; I work for a boutique leadership and communication consulting firm. As part of our service offerings, we provide clients a private and secure performance / developmental review site where employees are able to provide one another feedback on a regular cadence. We initially used an internal site, but as the scale of our projects and clients began to increase, we knew we needed to increase the sophistication of our site. That's where AllianceTek came in. Working together hand-in-hand, we developed a site tailored to the needs of our clients. Since development of the site, we've had clients ask for increased personalization and customization, and AllianceTek has been able to help us develop these in an expedient and efficient manner. Another bonus is that even after several years of working together, we've had the same points of contact throughout. This has been an invaluable part of us working together so well. After the past few years of working together, I couldn't recommend AllianceTek highly enough.; ; AllianceTek has delivered outstanding products and services which has helped Strategas achieve outstanding recognition from our financial services clients. Beyond those technical achievements, what sets this team apart from the crowd is the rapid responsiveness to my requests, be it a production problem, coding change, or business challenge; that kind of responsiveness is an exceptional work ethic not frequently seen in our industry and highly valued by my firm. I can always count upon this team to respond in kind with their best efforts.; ; "
Tudip Technologies Pvt. Ltd.,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2010,"I have been working with Tudip on several projects and what distinguishes a good QA team from Tudip is their consistency, the ability to have great judgement and the attention to detail.

LambdaTest,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2017,"Being a developer, responsive testing comes as a part of the package, every time I develop a webpage. I have been relying over LambdaTest for responsive testing. They have a feature which allows me to capture full page screenshots of my webpages in scores of different devices. I could even capture web pages that are locally hosted. And now, they have come up with a browser that lets me not only capture screenshots but interact with my websites in 25+ different devices, in a side by side view. That allows me to test my website responsiveness on a bunch of devices in a live-interactive manner. I must admit I am highly impressed by the LT browser and I am a tough guy to impress.; We use LambdaTest across our development & testing team. Our developers always perform cross browser tests on their local pages across different browsers and their versions before sending them to the testers. The integrations with 3rd party tools make it more useful. It provides a full development environment that looks very close to the real thing.Before we started using LambdaTest, we're limited to the browsers and their versions that are available on our desktops and laptops. But now with LambdaTest, we are using Selenium grid of 2000+ browsers and their versions available on the platform.If you want a solution to replace testing infrastructure that is hard to main and look after, LambdaTest is the best solution according to us.; Have been using Lambdatest for around 1 year now, and could say that it’s a useful testing tool for our team. Offering great combinations of browsers and operating systems for you to test on and most importantly there are many types of additional logs that come with each test which helps in debugging.. Glad to see the integration with Travis CI due to which we could optimally use this tool with our CI CD pipelines directly. We were able to effectively run TestNG and Selenium tests using their documentation and as an added advantage their support team is quick and helpful.; The industry we function (e-commerce) has a broad category of audience. We need to make sure our website is accessible to everyone irrespective of the browser / operating system they use. Ofcourse, responsive web design check is a major bullet point over our testing checklist as well. As a B2C, it's crucial for us to stay ahead of the customers and we wanted a solution which could help us ensure our changes would work seamlessly when shipped to the Production. LambdaTest made a great fit here when considered the latest browsers on the product, ability to test local pages along with a complimentary access to LT browser which is an absolute delight for our developers and testers. It helps us save a considerable effort on responsive testing plus the native developer tools allow us to dig deep into any UI mismatch! Also As mentioned we could achieve wider test coverage in time by running multiple combinations of browsers in parallel with LambdaTest automation suite. Our director to purchase the subscription was due to their affordable pricing for the parallel tests and the communication from the support team!; Running tests serially can be a good option when your product is at an early stage. But as we scaled the product, we needed a tool to reduce test time execution and pace up our test cycles. LambdaTest simplified the Selenium testing experience for us with their cloud based platform which allowed us to execute our test cases in parallel on hundreds of browsers. We could easily automate the test cases, get the sessions recorded and share the test reports across the team for assessment using Asana integration. We even leverage the integration with CircleCI to run automated tests on LambdaTest through our pipeline. The CircleCI Orb is handy for testing our privately hosted application.It’s good to see now that using LambdaTest we could run multiple tests on multiple VM’s, saving us hours of testing time and maintenance cost of local infrastructure. Personally, one thing that LambdaTest does very well is continuing to provide tutorials for testing, so that we stay up to speed and are even able to learn new things.I definitely saw myself applying a lot of the new concepts that I learned from their blogs.; As technology advances, enterprises are switching from manual testing to Selenium Test Automation. But one area most enterprises are still struggling is with the scalability of running several tests in parallel. LambdaTest has been a boon for us when it comes to Selenium automation. With a Selenium Grid based on the cloud, we don't need to stress about setting up and maintaining infrastructure anymore. We can run hundreds of tests in parallel on 2000+ browsers and OS versions running on real machines. LambdaTest really helped us in reducing our web testing cost and at the same time scale it as and when required.To leverage on marketing campaigns, we needed to ensure all our deliverables render seamlessly on different mobile and desktop browsers our users use to view them from across the world. The geolocation testing functionality helped us set the location and test our website over various locations. At LambdaTest, we can now run geolocation testing to test our website across 40+ countries. The pricing plan is pretty simple and easy to grasp, with no hidden costs at all.; We needed a testing tool that was scalable enough to cover all the browsers and OS as per our clients requirement and at the same time integrate well into our workflow. Lambdatest provided us with the necessary features to meet our browser compatibility testing requirements. Without any hassle of configuring, installing or maintaining the virtual machines, we are able to launch local browser tests instantly. The best part is, Lambdatest also helps us run our Selenium based automated tests on its cloud infra - that too without burning a hole in our pocket. They offer extensive mobile and desktop browsers, thereby increasing our test coverage to maximum.; We serve a variety of clients across industries, thus we need to make sure our website is accessible from every desktop, mobile browser combination they use. Responsive web design is an integral part of our testing process. As a B2B, you want to make sure that your services are always a step ahead of your customers. And to achieve that, it's important to have a tool that keeps your code and web designing process in sync with the Production.LambdaTest's variety of browsers and local testing capabilities made it a perfect fit for our requirements. Additionally we got free access to LT Browser which is absolutely loved by our developers. We are now in a better position while tackling misbehaving websites with the help of it’s inbuilt dev tools. The best part is that LambdaTest offers an automated parallel testing that helped us achieve faster and wider test coverage over multiple browsers. Its affordable price and fast technical support made the purchase decision very easy for the team. And yes I absolutely love their support staff. They are truly available for 24*7.; While we develop our web applications, our top concern was to verify the unintentional changes to the application's visuals. We need to make sure that changing one component doesn't break the styling of another component. LambdaTest's Smart testing helped us to identify visual regression bugs for every new build. We could capture our website screenshots belonging to different environments i.e stage and production & upload them on the LambdaTest Visual Testing platform. We were able to discover visual deviations with pixel to pixel comparison by capturing screenshots, comparing them against the baseline image, and highlighting visual changes. The slider mode is very helpful to compare the visual discrepancies between the two images by toggling them. Overall, Smart testing helped us perform reliable visual testing at scale and eliminated the risk of delivering visual bugs."
Serverspace,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2019,"First of all I would like to thank Serverspace for this great platform! Out of other VPS services, this is my favorite, it offers me the flexibility to enhance my skills as a Full-Stack Developer as well as a server administrator. Well out of frustrations from other VPS services, since they have a lot of hassle to work on, this platform enabled me to easily pick my choice, add new memory capability just by a few clicks. I observed the great UI/UX of this platform, and I am planning to use this forever until this platform is still working.; I tried many cloud server providers like AWS, Azure, Google cloud and more but they didn't satisfy my needs but when I tried Serverspace I was shocked because of their server prices, for a startup that will be the best option, I saw that the price is low but the service is best as expensive, I am fully satisfied with this. I recommend Serverspace for startups once a time you see, a cybercriminal attacked my server in serverspace but... the company has reported me on time, so I saved my server from further attacks, Serverspace saved a lot of time and money.; What I like about this company is the many options offered to us customers since I'm a Windows/Linux User and most of my needs rely on multi-OS systems. That's why I run 4 servers with ServerSpace. Their Windows Machines are as good as you can imagine, they offer all the alternatives I need, and I also run servers with CentOS. With Serverspace, I can cover all my needs for my business, and the best part is I also have different options on the payment side. They only charge me for the current use and not a whole monthly amount in advance, and I can cancel any server I ordered at any second. Also, their support tickets get answered right away. It's pretty good. What I think they could do better is improve their automatic system detecting payments with Ever. Every time I pay with Ever, I have to send a support ticket with transaction ID and all info about the payment to add funds. I get a reply the same day, but I'd rather not have to notify it. I'm very happy with this service, and I'll; I tried six to seven cloud services before I settled with Serverspace. I am glad that I found it. All I need was a reliable, scalable, economical, and user-friendly server for my data crunching and web application. First, their pricing is way attractive. The bigger sites may start with some low teaser rates or even free credits, but their prices go up exponentially with more CPU and memory. Serverspace's pricing remains very reasonable. Granted they don't offer super big servers, I don't need them either. The other thing I like is that they charge significantly less when you turn off the server while other sites charge you the same. I like their simple offers; simple servers that let me build my own environments. The plethora of bells and whistles elsewhere turn me off. Their servers are generally reliable except they failed to turn on a couple of times. But they fixed it promptly and were responsive through the process. Their clean and intuitive web UI is helpful.; I work most of the time but I also trade forex to make some extra money. Since I am not always at home, I had to get an expert advisor for my trades and that was when I started looking for a reliable VPS service. I have been using Serverspace VPS for less than a year now and I can say it has been a peaceful experience in the sense that I never had to worry about shutting down of the server. It's very pocket-friendly and I like that I can pay daily as I use it. What I enjoy most is the option to shutdown a server without deleting or destroying it completely, that way I can restart the server when I need it and continue using it. Like I said, you only get charged for what you use. For a little fee, you also have the option to increase the size or speed of a VPS server if your work becomes bigger without having to get a new server. I can only hope to get more than 50 Mbps speed for the fixed plan as it takes more time to work when everything is so slow.; I have been using Serverspace for about 6 months now. System performance is good. I have never used a VPS before, so I need some help getting up and running. Support always answers back thru a support ticket, although you may have to wait up to 6 hours sometimes, the support is good. Their pricing has been great, and I plan to stay with the service.; Before I decided to use their servers to host our services, I checked out and tried many alternatives. Some time ago I found Serverspace at some offers comparer and I decided to give it a try and I'm really satisfied. There are no problems with servers which I met using servers from others. So at the moment, I think I will use Serverspace servers for my other projects and initiatives.; I like Serverspace! The relation between the purchase price and the performance is perfect. I like dealing with you because of the cheap prices and high performance. Also, the support team is fast, I always get my tickets resolved as fast as possible. The deployment of services is also fast. In general, I do have a good experience and would like to build a long-term relationship.; The uptime and the speed of the service are fantastic. The quality of support is second to none. Every time I need help, I get a very personalized answer and they always go the extra mile to solve my problem. I have tried many competitors in the past but none of them come close to the quality of service I am getting in Serverspace."

A member of their team, Luis Sanchez was in charge of the project, we had several meetings to define the content and structure of the first sites. Later, he presented us graphic proposals and based on this, they began to develop. During development there were adjustments; Comparing them with the company I had worked with before, their communications are way superior. I always know exactly what they're working on, specifically the stage of the process where they're at. In addition, they're always upfront whenever things might take longer than expected. However, for the most part, they've completed things in a timely manner or even ahead of schedule.; We started working with a cloud specialist, who reviewed our current systems and implemented a work plan to migrate to the cloud. The process did not take that long, but we had complications migrating the information as our old servers were constantly crashing due to the workload. Eventually we managed to migrate everything, and from there Codebay has provided us with maintenance services.; We start by planning the different stages of development with the support of an architect and the design area. We already had a system made in .NET, so the new platform was programmed in the same language. The development had different variables which took a year to complete, currently we continue working with them with support and system improvements.; We have worked together for a few months and it has been a positive experience, the team besides being very committed to development, they have shown good technical skills. The management team has been aware of any issue and has been very open to follow up on doubts.; Codebay has served as the supporting development team for a startup incubation university. They’ve taken on multiple projects, which have included e-commerce development and site maintenance."

$25 - $49/hr ",2004,"We are a startup fintech company and needed to develop a mobile app in iOS and Android. The app is a social media platform for investing with back end analytics similar to Twitter. The development required integration with a high end data provider and a separate charting platform. After interviewing multiple (8) companies, I selected Alliancetek because they were experienced, offered end to end solutions beyond a standard mobile app firm, and their price point was below competing firms.Alliancetek delivered on all promises with great professionalism. We had to pivot several times in the course of the project and each hurdle was handled without a hitch. My “team” consisted of 3 Alliancetek employees (1 project manager, 1 iOS developer, 1 Android developer) who I spoke with weekly through Microsoft Team meetings. There were additional back end developers who worked on the project. I had an outstanding experience and give Alliancetek my highest recommendation.; My company was close to the launch date for a software platform that allows aspiring US college athletes to get recruited. It was a complex system involving many different elements, user types and features. With our primary in-house developer, we were running very late on our development schedule. We had a few months left to finish off the system before our customers began to use it. We brought AllianceTek on and they helped us get over the line with their amazing, responsive and high quality work. Without their tremendous work, we would not have been able to get over the line and give our customers a product that would be helpful to them. AllianceTek were honestly a game changer, and I could not imagine being where we are today as a company without their heavy and continued involvement.; The project has moved extremely smooth. The communication, the Dev team, I mean all of you guys over at Alliance Tech have just blown away my expectations and I can't thank you guys enough for helping me bring this idea into a reality. This is going to, not just revolutionise the industry, but revolutionise sales training in general. it's going to be able to present different scenarios, to the training platform getting feedback and uploading their videos to train to where we can train hundreds of people at the same time. I mean guys, this software that you guys have helped bring to life is truly going to change the industry.; Sokolis Group has been working with AllianceTek for almost a decade. We partnered with them to design and build a proprietary application that is critical to our business for analyzing and reporting our clients' fuel transaction data. Over the years, we have continued to work with AllianceTek to develop new features which helped make our business more efficient and our reporting to clients more insightful. In addition, AllianceTek provides the hosting and maintenance for this cloud-based application and we trust them to handle this important responsibility. They are a valued partner to our business and I would not hesitate to recommend them.; I work for a boutique leadership and communication consulting firm. As part of our service offerings, we provide clients a private and secure performance / developmental review site where employees are able to provide one another feedback on a regular cadence. We initially used an internal site, but as the scale of our projects and clients began to increase, we knew we needed to increase the sophistication of our site. That's where AllianceTek came in. Working together hand-in-hand, we developed a site tailored to the needs of our clients. Since development of the site, we've had clients ask for increased personalization and customization, and AllianceTek has been able to help us develop these in an expedient and efficient manner. Another bonus is that even after several years of working together, we've had the same points of contact throughout. This has been an invaluable part of us working together so well. After the past few years of working together, I couldn't recommend AllianceTek highly enough.; ; AllianceTek has delivered outstanding products and services which has helped Strategas achieve outstanding recognition from our financial services clients. Beyond those technical achievements, what sets this team apart from the crowd is the rapid responsiveness to my requests, be it a production problem, coding change, or business challenge; that kind of responsiveness is an exceptional work ethic not frequently seen in our industry and highly valued by my firm. I can always count upon this team to respond in kind with their best efforts.; ; "

LambdaTest,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2017,"Being a developer, responsive testing comes as a part of the package, every time I develop a webpage. I have been relying over LambdaTest for responsive testing. They have a feature which allows me to capture full page screenshots of my webpages in scores of different devices. I could even capture web pages that are locally hosted. And now, they have come up with a browser that lets me not only capture screenshots but interact with my websites in 25+ different devices, in a side by side view. That allows me to test my website responsiveness on a bunch of devices in a live-interactive manner. I must admit I am highly impressed by the LT browser and I am a tough guy to impress.; We use LambdaTest across our development & testing team. Our developers always perform cross browser tests on their local pages across different browsers and their versions before sending them to the testers. The integrations with 3rd party tools make it more useful. It provides a full development environment that looks very close to the real thing.Before we started using LambdaTest, we're limited to the browsers and their versions that are available on our desktops and laptops. But now with LambdaTest, we are using Selenium grid of 2000+ browsers and their versions available on the platform.If you want a solution to replace testing infrastructure that is hard to main and look after, LambdaTest is the best solution according to us.; Have been using Lambdatest for around 1 year now, and could say that it’s a useful testing tool for our team. Offering great combinations of browsers and operating systems for you to test on and most importantly there are many types of additional logs that come with each test which helps in debugging.. Glad to see the integration with Travis CI due to which we could optimally use this tool with our CI CD pipelines directly. We were able to effectively run TestNG and Selenium tests using their documentation and as an added advantage their support team is quick and helpful.; The industry we function (e-commerce) has a broad category of audience. We need to make sure our website is accessible to everyone irrespective of the browser / operating system they use. Ofcourse, responsive web design check is a major bullet point over our testing checklist as well. As a B2C, it's crucial for us to stay ahead of the customers and we wanted a solution which could help us ensure our changes would work seamlessly when shipped to the Production. LambdaTest made a great fit here when considered the latest browsers on the product, ability to test local pages along with a complimentary access to LT browser which is an absolute delight for our developers and testers. It helps us save a considerable effort on responsive testing plus the native developer tools allow us to dig deep into any UI mismatch! Also As mentioned we could achieve wider test coverage in time by running multiple combinations of browsers in parallel with LambdaTest automation suite. Our director to purchase the subscription was due to their affordable pricing for the parallel tests and the communication from the support team!; Running tests serially can be a good option when your product is at an early stage. But as we scaled the product, we needed a tool to reduce test time execution and pace up our test cycles. LambdaTest simplified the Selenium testing experience for us with their cloud based platform which allowed us to execute our test cases in parallel on hundreds of browsers. We could easily automate the test cases, get the sessions recorded and share the test reports across the team for assessment using Asana integration. We even leverage the integration with CircleCI to run automated tests on LambdaTest through our pipeline. The CircleCI Orb is handy for testing our privately hosted application.It’s good to see now that using LambdaTest we could run multiple tests on multiple VM’s, saving us hours of testing time and maintenance cost of local infrastructure. Personally, one thing that LambdaTest does very well is continuing to provide tutorials for testing, so that we stay up to speed and are even able to learn new things.I definitely saw myself applying a lot of the new concepts that I learned from their blogs.; As technology advances, enterprises are switching from manual testing to Selenium Test Automation. But one area most enterprises are still struggling is with the scalability of running several tests in parallel. LambdaTest has been a boon for us when it comes to Selenium automation. With a Selenium Grid based on the cloud, we don't need to stress about setting up and maintaining infrastructure anymore. We can run hundreds of tests in parallel on 2000+ browsers and OS versions running on real machines. LambdaTest really helped us in reducing our web testing cost and at the same time scale it as and when required.To leverage on marketing campaigns, we needed to ensure all our deliverables render seamlessly on different mobile and desktop browsers our users use to view them from across the world. The geolocation testing functionality helped us set the location and test our website over various locations. At LambdaTest, we can now run geolocation testing to test our website across 40+ countries. The pricing plan is pretty simple and easy to grasp, with no hidden costs at all.; We needed a testing tool that was scalable enough to cover all the browsers and OS as per our clients requirement and at the same time integrate well into our workflow. Lambdatest provided us with the necessary features to meet our browser compatibility testing requirements. Without any hassle of configuring, installing or maintaining the virtual machines, we are able to launch local browser tests instantly. The best part is, Lambdatest also helps us run our Selenium based automated tests on its cloud infra - that too without burning a hole in our pocket. They offer extensive mobile and desktop browsers, thereby increasing our test coverage to maximum.; We serve a variety of clients across industries, thus we need to make sure our website is accessible from every desktop, mobile browser combination they use. Responsive web design is an integral part of our testing process. As a B2B, you want to make sure that your services are always a step ahead of your customers. And to achieve that, it's important to have a tool that keeps your code and web designing process in sync with the Production.LambdaTest's variety of browsers and local testing capabilities made it a perfect fit for our requirements. Additionally we got free access to LT Browser which is absolutely loved by our developers. We are now in a better position while tackling misbehaving websites with the help of it’s inbuilt dev tools. The best part is that LambdaTest offers an automated parallel testing that helped us achieve faster and wider test coverage over multiple browsers. Its affordable price and fast technical support made the purchase decision very easy for the team. And yes I absolutely love their support staff. They are truly available for 24*7.; While we develop our web applications, our top concern was to verify the unintentional changes to the application's visuals. We need to make sure that changing one component doesn't break the styling of another component. LambdaTest's Smart testing helped us to identify visual regression bugs for every new build. We could capture our website screenshots belonging to different environments i.e stage and production & upload them on the LambdaTest Visual Testing platform. We were able to discover visual deviations with pixel to pixel comparison by capturing screenshots, comparing them against the baseline image, and highlighting visual changes. The slider mode is very helpful to compare the visual discrepancies between the two images by toggling them. Overall, Smart testing helped us perform reliable visual testing at scale and eliminated the risk of delivering visual bugs."
Serverspace,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2019,"First of all I would like to thank Serverspace for this great platform! Out of other VPS services, this is my favorite, it offers me the flexibility to enhance my skills as a Full-Stack Developer as well as a server administrator. Well out of frustrations from other VPS services, since they have a lot of hassle to work on, this platform enabled me to easily pick my choice, add new memory capability just by a few clicks. I observed the great UI/UX of this platform, and I am planning to use this forever until this platform is still working.; I tried many cloud server providers like AWS, Azure, Google cloud and more but they didn't satisfy my needs but when I tried Serverspace I was shocked because of their server prices, for a startup that will be the best option, I saw that the price is low but the service is best as expensive, I am fully satisfied with this. I recommend Serverspace for startups once a time you see, a cybercriminal attacked my server in serverspace but... the company has reported me on time, so I saved my server from further attacks, Serverspace saved a lot of time and money.; What I like about this company is the many options offered to us customers since I'm a Windows/Linux User and most of my needs rely on multi-OS systems. That's why I run 4 servers with ServerSpace. Their Windows Machines are as good as you can imagine, they offer all the alternatives I need, and I also run servers with CentOS. With Serverspace, I can cover all my needs for my business, and the best part is I also have different options on the payment side. They only charge me for the current use and not a whole monthly amount in advance, and I can cancel any server I ordered at any second. Also, their support tickets get answered right away. It's pretty good. What I think they could do better is improve their automatic system detecting payments with Ever. Every time I pay with Ever, I have to send a support ticket with transaction ID and all info about the payment to add funds. I get a reply the same day, but I'd rather not have to notify it. I'm very happy with this service, and I'll; I tried six to seven cloud services before I settled with Serverspace. I am glad that I found it. All I need was a reliable, scalable, economical, and user-friendly server for my data crunching and web application. First, their pricing is way attractive. The bigger sites may start with some low teaser rates or even free credits, but their prices go up exponentially with more CPU and memory. Serverspace's pricing remains very reasonable. Granted they don't offer super big servers, I don't need them either. The other thing I like is that they charge significantly less when you turn off the server while other sites charge you the same. I like their simple offers; simple servers that let me build my own environments. The plethora of bells and whistles elsewhere turn me off. Their servers are generally reliable except they failed to turn on a couple of times. But they fixed it promptly and were responsive through the process. Their clean and intuitive web UI is helpful.; I work most of the time but I also trade forex to make some extra money. Since I am not always at home, I had to get an expert advisor for my trades and that was when I started looking for a reliable VPS service. I have been using Serverspace VPS for less than a year now and I can say it has been a peaceful experience in the sense that I never had to worry about shutting down of the server. It's very pocket-friendly and I like that I can pay daily as I use it. What I enjoy most is the option to shutdown a server without deleting or destroying it completely, that way I can restart the server when I need it and continue using it. Like I said, you only get charged for what you use. For a little fee, you also have the option to increase the size or speed of a VPS server if your work becomes bigger without having to get a new server. I can only hope to get more than 50 Mbps speed for the fixed plan as it takes more time to work when everything is so slow.; I have been using Serverspace for about 6 months now. System performance is good. I have never used a VPS before, so I need some help getting up and running. Support always answers back thru a support ticket, although you may have to wait up to 6 hours sometimes, the support is good. Their pricing has been great, and I plan to stay with the service.; Before I decided to use their servers to host our services, I checked out and tried many alternatives. Some time ago I found Serverspace at some offers comparer and I decided to give it a try and I'm really satisfied. There are no problems with servers which I met using servers from others. So at the moment, I think I will use Serverspace servers for my other projects and initiatives.; I like Serverspace! The relation between the purchase price and the performance is perfect. I like dealing with you because of the cheap prices and high performance. Also, the support team is fast, I always get my tickets resolved as fast as possible. The deployment of services is also fast. In general, I do have a good experience and would like to build a long-term relationship.; The uptime and the speed of the service are fantastic. The quality of support is second to none. Every time I need help, I get a very personalized answer and they always go the extra mile to solve my problem. I have tried many competitors in the past but none of them come close to the quality of service I am getting in Serverspace."

The final project was delivered and implemented without major complications. Currently the Codebay team provides us with support and system updates.; We hire them for the development of a web application. A member of their team, Luis Sanchez was in charge of the project, we had several meetings to define the content and structure of the first sites. Later, he presented us graphic proposals and based on this, they began to develop. During development there were adjustments; Comparing them with the company I had worked with before, their communications are way superior.

The app is a social media platform for investing with back end analytics similar to Twitter. The development required integration with a high end data provider and a separate charting platform. After interviewing multiple (8) companies, I selected Alliancetek because they were experienced, offered end to end solutions beyond a standard mobile app firm, and their price point was below competing firms.Alliancetek delivered on all promises with great professionalism. We had to pivot several times in the course of the project and each hurdle was handled without a hitch. My “team” consisted of 3 Alliancetek employees (1 project manager, 1 iOS developer, 1 Android developer) who I spoke with weekly through Microsoft Team meetings. There were additional back end developers who worked on the project. I had an outstanding experience and give Alliancetek my highest recommendation.; My company was close to the launch date for a software platform that allows aspiring US college athletes to get recruited. It was a complex system involving many different elements, user types and features. With our primary in-house developer, we were running very late on our development schedule. We had a few months left to finish off the system before our customers began to use it. We brought AllianceTek on and they helped us get over the line with their amazing, responsive and high quality work. Without their tremendous work, we would not have been able to get over the line and give our customers a product that would be helpful to them. AllianceTek were honestly a game changer, and I could not imagine being where we are today as a company without their heavy and continued involvement.; The project has moved extremely smooth. The communication, the Dev team, I mean all of you guys over at Alliance Tech have just blown away my expectations and I can't thank you guys enough for helping me bring this idea into a reality. This is going to, not just revolutionise the industry, but revolutionise sales training in general. it's going to be able to present different scenarios, to the training platform getting feedback and uploading their videos to train to where we can train hundreds of people at the same time. I mean guys, this software that you guys have helped bring to life is truly going to change the industry.; Sokolis Group has been working with AllianceTek for almost a decade. We partnered with them to design and build a proprietary application that is critical to our business for analyzing and reporting our clients' fuel transaction data. Over the years, we have continued to work with AllianceTek to develop new features which helped make our business more efficient and our reporting to clients more insightful. In addition, AllianceTek provides the hosting and maintenance for this cloud-based application and we trust them to handle this important responsibility. They are a valued partner to our business and I would not hesitate to recommend them.; I work for a boutique leadership and communication consulting firm. As part of our service offerings, we provide clients a private and secure performance / developmental review site where employees are able to provide one another feedback on a regular cadence. We initially used an internal site, but as the scale of our projects and clients began to increase, we knew we needed to increase the sophistication of our site. That's where AllianceTek came in. Working together hand-in-hand, we developed a site tailored to the needs of our clients. Since development of the site, we've had clients ask for increased personalization and customization, and AllianceTek has been able to help us develop these in an expedient and efficient manner. Another bonus is that even after several years of working together, we've had the same points of contact throughout. This has been an invaluable part of us working together so well. After the past few years of working together, I couldn't recommend AllianceTek highly enough.; ; AllianceTek has delivered outstanding products and services which has helped Strategas achieve outstanding recognition from our financial services clients. Beyond those technical achievements, what sets this team apart from the crowd is the rapid responsiveness to my requests, be it a production problem, coding change, or business challenge; that kind of responsiveness is an exceptional work ethic not frequently seen in our industry and highly valued by my firm. I can always count upon this team to respond in kind with their best efforts.; ; "

LambdaTest,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2017,"Being a developer, responsive testing comes as a part of the package, every time I develop a webpage. I have been relying over LambdaTest for responsive testing. They have a feature which allows me to capture full page screenshots of my webpages in scores of different devices. I could even capture web pages that are locally hosted. And now, they have come up with a browser that lets me not only capture screenshots but interact with my websites in 25+ different devices, in a side by side view. That allows me to test my website responsiveness on a bunch of devices in a live-interactive manner. I must admit I am highly impressed by the LT browser and I am a tough guy to impress.; We use LambdaTest across our development & testing team. Our developers always perform cross browser tests on their local pages across different browsers and their versions before sending them to the testers. The integrations with 3rd party tools make it more useful. It provides a full development environment that looks very close to the real thing.Before we started using LambdaTest, we're limited to the browsers and their versions that are available on our desktops and laptops. But now with LambdaTest, we are using Selenium grid of 2000+ browsers and their versions available on the platform.If you want a solution to replace testing infrastructure that is hard to main and look after, LambdaTest is the best solution according to us.; Have been using Lambdatest for around 1 year now, and could say that it’s a useful testing tool for our team. Offering great combinations of browsers and operating systems for you to test on and most importantly there are many types of additional logs that come with each test which helps in debugging.. Glad to see the integration with Travis CI due to which we could optimally use this tool with our CI CD pipelines directly. We were able to effectively run TestNG and Selenium tests using their documentation and as an added advantage their support team is quick and helpful.; The industry we function (e-commerce) has a broad category of audience. We need to make sure our website is accessible to everyone irrespective of the browser / operating system they use. Ofcourse, responsive web design check is a major bullet point over our testing checklist as well. As a B2C, it's crucial for us to stay ahead of the customers and we wanted a solution which could help us ensure our changes would work seamlessly when shipped to the Production. LambdaTest made a great fit here when considered the latest browsers on the product, ability to test local pages along with a complimentary access to LT browser which is an absolute delight for our developers and testers. It helps us save a considerable effort on responsive testing plus the native developer tools allow us to dig deep into any UI mismatch! Also As mentioned we could achieve wider test coverage in time by running multiple combinations of browsers in parallel with LambdaTest automation suite. Our director to purchase the subscription was due to their affordable pricing for the parallel tests and the communication from the support team!; Running tests serially can be a good option when your product is at an early stage. But as we scaled the product, we needed a tool to reduce test time execution and pace up our test cycles. LambdaTest simplified the Selenium testing experience for us with their cloud based platform which allowed us to execute our test cases in parallel on hundreds of browsers. We could easily automate the test cases, get the sessions recorded and share the test reports across the team for assessment using Asana integration. We even leverage the integration with CircleCI to run automated tests on LambdaTest through our pipeline. The CircleCI Orb is handy for testing our privately hosted application.It’s good to see now that using LambdaTest we could run multiple tests on multiple VM’s, saving us hours of testing time and maintenance cost of local infrastructure. Personally, one thing that LambdaTest does very well is continuing to provide tutorials for testing, so that we stay up to speed and are even able to learn new things.I definitely saw myself applying a lot of the new concepts that I learned from their blogs.; As technology advances, enterprises are switching from manual testing to Selenium Test Automation. But one area most enterprises are still struggling is with the scalability of running several tests in parallel. LambdaTest has been a boon for us when it comes to Selenium automation. With a Selenium Grid based on the cloud, we don't need to stress about setting up and maintaining infrastructure anymore. We can run hundreds of tests in parallel on 2000+ browsers and OS versions running on real machines. LambdaTest really helped us in reducing our web testing cost and at the same time scale it as and when required.To leverage on marketing campaigns, we needed to ensure all our deliverables render seamlessly on different mobile and desktop browsers our users use to view them from across the world. The geolocation testing functionality helped us set the location and test our website over various locations. At LambdaTest, we can now run geolocation testing to test our website across 40+ countries. The pricing plan is pretty simple and easy to grasp, with no hidden costs at all.; We needed a testing tool that was scalable enough to cover all the browsers and OS as per our clients requirement and at the same time integrate well into our workflow. Lambdatest provided us with the necessary features to meet our browser compatibility testing requirements. Without any hassle of configuring, installing or maintaining the virtual machines, we are able to launch local browser tests instantly. The best part is, Lambdatest also helps us run our Selenium based automated tests on its cloud infra - that too without burning a hole in our pocket. They offer extensive mobile and desktop browsers, thereby increasing our test coverage to maximum.; We serve a variety of clients across industries, thus we need to make sure our website is accessible from every desktop, mobile browser combination they use. Responsive web design is an integral part of our testing process. As a B2B, you want to make sure that your services are always a step ahead of your customers. And to achieve that, it's important to have a tool that keeps your code and web designing process in sync with the Production.LambdaTest's variety of browsers and local testing capabilities made it a perfect fit for our requirements. Additionally we got free access to LT Browser which is absolutely loved by our developers. We are now in a better position while tackling misbehaving websites with the help of it’s inbuilt dev tools. The best part is that LambdaTest offers an automated parallel testing that helped us achieve faster and wider test coverage over multiple browsers. Its affordable price and fast technical support made the purchase decision very easy for the team. And yes I absolutely love their support staff. They are truly available for 24*7.; While we develop our web applications, our top concern was to verify the unintentional changes to the application's visuals. We need to make sure that changing one component doesn't break the styling of another component. LambdaTest's Smart testing helped us to identify visual regression bugs for every new build. We could capture our website screenshots belonging to different environments i.e stage and production & upload them on the LambdaTest Visual Testing platform. We were able to discover visual deviations with pixel to pixel comparison by capturing screenshots, comparing them against the baseline image, and highlighting visual changes. The slider mode is very helpful to compare the visual discrepancies between the two images by toggling them. Overall, Smart testing helped us perform reliable visual testing at scale and eliminated the risk of delivering visual bugs."
Serverspace,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2019,"First of all I would like to thank Serverspace for this great platform! Out of other VPS services, this is my favorite, it offers me the flexibility to enhance my skills as a Full-Stack Developer as well as a server administrator. Well out of frustrations from other VPS services, since they have a lot of hassle to work on, this platform enabled me to easily pick my choice, add new memory capability just by a few clicks. I observed the great UI/UX of this platform, and I am planning to use this forever until this platform is still working.; I tried many cloud server providers like AWS, Azure, Google cloud and more but they didn't satisfy my needs but when I tried Serverspace I was shocked because of their server prices, for a startup that will be the best option, I saw that the price is low but the service is best as expensive, I am fully satisfied with this. I recommend Serverspace for startups once a time you see, a cybercriminal attacked my server in serverspace but... the company has reported me on time, so I saved my server from further attacks, Serverspace saved a lot of time and money.; What I like about this company is the many options offered to us customers since I'm a Windows/Linux User and most of my needs rely on multi-OS systems. That's why I run 4 servers with ServerSpace. Their Windows Machines are as good as you can imagine, they offer all the alternatives I need, and I also run servers with CentOS. With Serverspace, I can cover all my needs for my business, and the best part is I also have different options on the payment side. They only charge me for the current use and not a whole monthly amount in advance, and I can cancel any server I ordered at any second. Also, their support tickets get answered right away. It's pretty good. What I think they could do better is improve their automatic system detecting payments with Ever. Every time I pay with Ever, I have to send a support ticket with transaction ID and all info about the payment to add funds. I get a reply the same day, but I'd rather not have to notify it. I'm very happy with this service, and I'll; I tried six to seven cloud services before I settled with Serverspace. I am glad that I found it. All I need was a reliable, scalable, economical, and user-friendly server for my data crunching and web application. First, their pricing is way attractive. The bigger sites may start with some low teaser rates or even free credits, but their prices go up exponentially with more CPU and memory. Serverspace's pricing remains very reasonable. Granted they don't offer super big servers, I don't need them either. The other thing I like is that they charge significantly less when you turn off the server while other sites charge you the same. I like their simple offers; simple servers that let me build my own environments. The plethora of bells and whistles elsewhere turn me off. Their servers are generally reliable except they failed to turn on a couple of times. But they fixed it promptly and were responsive through the process. Their clean and intuitive web UI is helpful.; I work most of the time but I also trade forex to make some extra money. Since I am not always at home, I had to get an expert advisor for my trades and that was when I started looking for a reliable VPS service. I have been using Serverspace VPS for less than a year now and I can say it has been a peaceful experience in the sense that I never had to worry about shutting down of the server. It's very pocket-friendly and I like that I can pay daily as I use it. What I enjoy most is the option to shutdown a server without deleting or destroying it completely, that way I can restart the server when I need it and continue using it. Like I said, you only get charged for what you use. For a little fee, you also have the option to increase the size or speed of a VPS server if your work becomes bigger without having to get a new server. I can only hope to get more than 50 Mbps speed for the fixed plan as it takes more time to work when everything is so slow.; I have been using Serverspace for about 6 months now. System performance is good. I have never used a VPS before, so I need some help getting up and running. Support always answers back thru a support ticket, although you may have to wait up to 6 hours sometimes, the support is good. Their pricing has been great, and I plan to stay with the service.; Before I decided to use their servers to host our services, I checked out and tried many alternatives. Some time ago I found Serverspace at some offers comparer and I decided to give it a try and I'm really satisfied. There are no problems with servers which I met using servers from others. So at the moment, I think I will use Serverspace servers for my other projects and initiatives.; I like Serverspace! The relation between the purchase price and the performance is perfect. I like dealing with you because of the cheap prices and high performance. Also, the support team is fast, I always get my tickets resolved as fast as possible. The deployment of services is also fast. In general, I do have a good experience and would like to build a long-term relationship.; The uptime and the speed of the service are fantastic. The quality of support is second to none. Every time I need help, I get a very personalized answer and they always go the extra mile to solve my problem. I have tried many competitors in the past but none of them come close to the quality of service I am getting in Serverspace."

The app is a social media platform for investing with back end analytics similar to Twitter. The development required integration with a high end data provider and a separate charting platform. After interviewing multiple (8) companies, I selected Alliancetek because they were experienced, offered end to end solutions beyond a standard mobile app firm, and their price point was below competing firms.Alliancetek delivered on all promises with great professionalism. We had to pivot several times in the course of the project and each hurdle was handled without a hitch. My “team” consisted of 3 Alliancetek employees (1 project manager, 1 iOS developer, 1 Android developer) who I spoke with weekly through Microsoft Team meetings. There were additional back end developers who worked on the project. I had an outstanding experience and give Alliancetek my highest recommendation.; My company was close to the launch date for a software platform that allows aspiring US college athletes to get recruited. It was a complex system involving many different elements, user types and features. With our primary in-house developer, we were running very late on our development schedule. We had a few months left to finish off the system before our customers began to use it. We brought AllianceTek on and they helped us get over the line with their amazing, responsive and high quality work. Without their tremendous work, we would not have been able to get over the line and give our customers a product that would be helpful to them. AllianceTek were honestly a game changer, and I could not imagine being where we are today as a company without their heavy and continued involvement.; The project has moved extremely smooth. The communication, the Dev team, I mean all of you guys over at Alliance Tech have just blown away my expectations and I can't thank you guys enough for helping me bring this idea into a reality. This is going to, not just revolutionise the industry, but revolutionise sales training in general. it's going to be able to present different scenarios, to the training platform getting feedback and uploading their videos to train to where we can train hundreds of people at the same time. I mean guys, this software that you guys have helped bring to life is truly going to change the industry.; Sokolis Group has been working with AllianceTek for almost a decade. We partnered with them to design and build a proprietary application that is critical to our business for analyzing and reporting our clients' fuel transaction data. Over the years, we have continued to work with AllianceTek to develop new features which helped make our business more efficient and our reporting to clients more insightful. In addition, AllianceTek provides the hosting and maintenance for this cloud-based application and we trust them to handle this important responsibility. They are a valued partner to our business and I would not hesitate to recommend them.; I work for a boutique leadership and communication consulting firm. As part of our service offerings, we provide clients a private and secure performance / developmental review site where employees are able to provide one another feedback on a regular cadence. We initially used an internal site, but as the scale of our projects and clients began to increase, we knew we needed to increase the sophistication of our site. That's where AllianceTek came in. Working together hand-in-hand, we developed a site tailored to the needs of our clients. Since development of the site, we've had clients ask for increased personalization and customization, and AllianceTek has been able to help us develop these in an expedient and efficient manner. Another bonus is that even after several years of working together, we've had the same points of contact throughout. This has been an invaluable part of us working together so well. After the past few years of working together, I couldn't recommend AllianceTek highly enough.; ; AllianceTek has delivered outstanding products and services which has helped Strategas achieve outstanding recognition from our financial services clients. Beyond those technical achievements, what sets this team apart from the crowd is the rapid responsiveness to my requests, be it a production problem, coding change, or business challenge; that kind of responsiveness is an exceptional work ethic not frequently seen in our industry and highly valued by my firm. I can always count upon this team to respond in kind with their best efforts.; ; "

LambdaTest,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2017,"Being a developer, responsive testing comes as a part of the package, every time I develop a webpage. I have been relying over LambdaTest for responsive testing. They have a feature which allows me to capture full page screenshots of my webpages in scores of different devices. I could even capture web pages that are locally hosted. And now, they have come up with a browser that lets me not only capture screenshots but interact with my websites in 25+ different devices, in a side by side view. That allows me to test my website responsiveness on a bunch of devices in a live-interactive manner. I must admit I am highly impressed by the LT browser and I am a tough guy to impress.; We use LambdaTest across our development & testing team. Our developers always perform cross browser tests on their local pages across different browsers and their versions before sending them to the testers. The integrations with 3rd party tools make it more useful. It provides a full development environment that looks very close to the real thing.Before we started using LambdaTest, we're limited to the browsers and their versions that are available on our desktops and laptops. But now with LambdaTest, we are using Selenium grid of 2000+ browsers and their versions available on the platform.If you want a solution to replace testing infrastructure that is hard to main and look after, LambdaTest is the best solution according to us.; Have been using Lambdatest for around 1 year now, and could say that it’s a useful testing tool for our team. Offering great combinations of browsers and operating systems for you to test on and most importantly there are many types of additional logs that come with each test which helps in debugging.. Glad to see the integration with Travis CI due to which we could optimally use this tool with our CI CD pipelines directly. We were able to effectively run TestNG and Selenium tests using their documentation and as an added advantage their support team is quick and helpful.; The industry we function (e-commerce) has a broad category of audience. We need to make sure our website is accessible to everyone irrespective of the browser / operating system they use. Ofcourse, responsive web design check is a major bullet point over our testing checklist as well. As a B2C, it's crucial for us to stay ahead of the customers and we wanted a solution which could help us ensure our changes would work seamlessly when shipped to the Production. LambdaTest made a great fit here when considered the latest browsers on the product, ability to test local pages along with a complimentary access to LT browser which is an absolute delight for our developers and testers. It helps us save a considerable effort on responsive testing plus the native developer tools allow us to dig deep into any UI mismatch! Also As mentioned we could achieve wider test coverage in time by running multiple combinations of browsers in parallel with LambdaTest automation suite. Our director to purchase the subscription was due to their affordable pricing for the parallel tests and the communication from the support team!; Running tests serially can be a good option when your product is at an early stage. But as we scaled the product, we needed a tool to reduce test time execution and pace up our test cycles. LambdaTest simplified the Selenium testing experience for us with their cloud based platform which allowed us to execute our test cases in parallel on hundreds of browsers. We could easily automate the test cases, get the sessions recorded and share the test reports across the team for assessment using Asana integration. We even leverage the integration with CircleCI to run automated tests on LambdaTest through our pipeline. The CircleCI Orb is handy for testing our privately hosted application.It’s good to see now that using LambdaTest we could run multiple tests on multiple VM’s, saving us hours of testing time and maintenance cost of local infrastructure. Personally, one thing that LambdaTest does very well is continuing to provide tutorials for testing, so that we stay up to speed and are even able to learn new things.I definitely saw myself applying a lot of the new concepts that I learned from their blogs.; As technology advances, enterprises are switching from manual testing to Selenium Test Automation. But one area most enterprises are still struggling is with the scalability of running several tests in parallel. LambdaTest has been a boon for us when it comes to Selenium automation. With a Selenium Grid based on the cloud, we don't need to stress about setting up and maintaining infrastructure anymore. We can run hundreds of tests in parallel on 2000+ browsers and OS versions running on real machines. LambdaTest really helped us in reducing our web testing cost and at the same time scale it as and when required.To leverage on marketing campaigns, we needed to ensure all our deliverables render seamlessly on different mobile and desktop browsers our users use to view them from across the world. The geolocation testing functionality helped us set the location and test our website over various locations. At LambdaTest, we can now run geolocation testing to test our website across 40+ countries. The pricing plan is pretty simple and easy to grasp, with no hidden costs at all.; We needed a testing tool that was scalable enough to cover all the browsers and OS as per our clients requirement and at the same time integrate well into our workflow. Lambdatest provided us with the necessary features to meet our browser compatibility testing requirements. Without any hassle of configuring, installing or maintaining the virtual machines, we are able to launch local browser tests instantly. The best part is, Lambdatest also helps us run our Selenium based automated tests on its cloud infra - that too without burning a hole in our pocket. They offer extensive mobile and desktop browsers, thereby increasing our test coverage to maximum.; We serve a variety of clients across industries, thus we need to make sure our website is accessible from every desktop, mobile browser combination they use. Responsive web design is an integral part of our testing process. As a B2B, you want to make sure that your services are always a step ahead of your customers. And to achieve that, it's important to have a tool that keeps your code and web designing process in sync with the Production.LambdaTest's variety of browsers and local testing capabilities made it a perfect fit for our requirements. Additionally we got free access to LT Browser which is absolutely loved by our developers. We are now in a better position while tackling misbehaving websites with the help of it’s inbuilt dev tools. The best part is that LambdaTest offers an automated parallel testing that helped us achieve faster and wider test coverage over multiple browsers. Its affordable price and fast technical support made the purchase decision very easy for the team. And yes I absolutely love their support staff. They are truly available for 24*7.; While we develop our web applications, our top concern was to verify the unintentional changes to the application's visuals. We need to make sure that changing one component doesn't break the styling of another component. LambdaTest's Smart testing helped us to identify visual regression bugs for every new build. We could capture our website screenshots belonging to different environments i.e stage and production & upload them on the LambdaTest Visual Testing platform. We were able to discover visual deviations with pixel to pixel comparison by capturing screenshots, comparing them against the baseline image, and highlighting visual changes. The slider mode is very helpful to compare the visual discrepancies between the two images by toggling them. Overall, Smart testing helped us perform reliable visual testing at scale and eliminated the risk of delivering visual bugs."

I observed the great UI/UX of this platform, and I am planning to use this forever until this platform is still working.; I tried many cloud server providers like AWS, Azure, Google cloud and more but they didn't satisfy my needs but when I tried Serverspace I was shocked because of their server prices, for a startup that will be the best option, I saw that the price is low but the service is best as expensive, I am fully satisfied with this. I recommend Serverspace for startups once a time you see, a cybercriminal attacked my server in serverspace but... the company has reported me on time, so I saved my server from further attacks, Serverspace saved a lot of time and money.; What I like about this company is the many options offered to us customers since I'm a Windows/Linux User and most of my needs rely on multi-OS systems. That's why I run 4 servers with ServerSpace. Their Windows Machines are as good as you can imagine, they offer all the alternatives I need, and I also run servers with CentOS. With Serverspace, I can cover all my needs for my business, and the best part is I also have different options on the payment side. They only charge me for the current use and not a whole monthly amount in advance, and I can cancel any server I ordered at any second. Also, their support tickets get answered right away. It's pretty good. What I think they could do better is improve their automatic system detecting payments with Ever. Every time I pay with Ever, I have to send a support ticket with transaction ID and all info about the payment to add funds. I get a reply the same day, but I'd rather not have to notify it. I'm very happy with this service, and I'll; I tried six to seven cloud services before I settled with Serverspace. I am glad that I found it. All I need was a reliable, scalable, economical, and user-friendly server for my data crunching and web application. First, their pricing is way attractive. The bigger sites may start with some low teaser rates or even free credits, but their prices go up exponentially with more CPU and memory. Serverspace's pricing remains very reasonable. Granted they don't offer super big servers, I don't need them either. The other thing I like is that they charge significantly less when you turn off the server while other sites charge you the same. I like their simple offers; simple servers that let me build my own environments. The plethora of bells and whistles elsewhere turn me off. Their servers are generally reliable except they failed to turn on a couple of times. But they fixed it promptly and were responsive through the process. Their clean and intuitive web UI is helpful.; I work most of the time but I also trade forex to make some extra money. Since I am not always at home, I had to get an expert advisor for my trades and that was when I started looking for a reliable VPS service. I have been using Serverspace VPS for less than a year now and I can say it has been a peaceful experience in the sense that I never had to worry about shutting down of the server. It's very pocket-friendly and I like that I can pay daily as I use it. What I enjoy most is the option to shutdown a server without deleting or destroying it completely, that way I can restart the server when I need it and continue using it. Like I said, you only get charged for what you use. For a little fee, you also have the option to increase the size or speed of a VPS server if your work becomes bigger without having to get a new server. I can only hope to get more than 50 Mbps speed for the fixed plan as it takes more time to work when everything is so slow.; I have been using Serverspace for about 6 months now. System performance is good. I have never used a VPS before, so I need some help getting up and running. Support always answers back thru a support ticket, although you may have to wait up to 6 hours sometimes, the support is good. Their pricing has been great, and I plan to stay with the service.; Before I decided to use their servers to host our services, I checked out and tried many alternatives. Some time ago I found Serverspace at some offers comparer and I decided to give it a try and I'm really satisfied. There are no problems with servers which I met using servers from others. So at the moment, I think I will use Serverspace servers for my other projects and initiatives.; I like Serverspace! The relation between the purchase price and the performance is perfect. I like dealing with you because of the cheap prices and high performance. Also, the support team is fast, I always get my tickets resolved as fast as possible. The deployment of services is also fast. In general, I do have a good experience and would like to build a long-term relationship.; The uptime and the speed of the service are fantastic. The quality of support is second to none. Every time I need help, I get a very personalized answer and they always go the extra mile to solve my problem. I have tried many competitors in the past but none of them come close to the quality of service I am getting in Serverspace."

The app is a social media platform for investing with back end analytics similar to Twitter. The development required integration with a high end data provider and a separate charting platform. After interviewing multiple (8) companies, I selected Alliancetek because they were experienced, offered end to end solutions beyond a standard mobile app firm, and their price point was below competing firms.Alliancetek delivered on all promises with great professionalism. We had to pivot several times in the course of the project and each hurdle was handled without a hitch. My “team” consisted of 3 Alliancetek employees (1 project manager, 1 iOS developer, 1 Android developer) who I spoke with weekly through Microsoft Team meetings. There were additional back end developers who worked on the project. I had an outstanding experience and give Alliancetek my highest recommendation.; My company was close to the launch date for a software platform that allows aspiring US college athletes to get recruited. It was a complex system involving many different elements, user types and features. With our primary in-house developer, we were running very late on our development schedule. We had a few months left to finish off the system before our customers began to use it. We brought AllianceTek on and they helped us get over the line with their amazing, responsive and high quality work. Without their tremendous work, we would not have been able to get over the line and give our customers a product that would be helpful to them. AllianceTek were honestly a game changer, and I could not imagine being where we are today as a company without their heavy and continued involvement.; The project has moved extremely smooth.

We partnered with them to design and build a proprietary application that is critical to our business for analyzing and reporting our clients' fuel transaction data. Over the years, we have continued to work with AllianceTek to develop new features which helped make our business more efficient and our reporting to clients more insightful.

They are a valued partner to our business and I would not hesitate to recommend them.; I work for a boutique leadership and communication consulting firm. As part of our service offerings, we provide clients a private and secure performance / developmental review site where employees are able to provide one another feedback on a regular cadence. We initially used an internal site, but as the scale of our projects and clients began to increase, we knew we needed to increase the sophistication of our site. That's where AllianceTek came in. Working together hand-in-hand, we developed a site tailored to the needs of our clients. Since development of the site, we've had clients ask for increased personalization and customization, and AllianceTek has been able to help us develop these in an expedient and efficient manner. Another bonus is that even after several years of working together, we've had the same points of contact throughout. This has been an invaluable part of us working together so well. After the past few years of working together, I couldn't recommend AllianceTek highly enough.; ; AllianceTek has delivered outstanding products and services which has helped Strategas achieve outstanding recognition from our financial services clients. Beyond those technical achievements, what sets this team apart from the crowd is the rapid responsiveness to my requests, be it a production problem, coding change, or business challenge; that kind of responsiveness is an exceptional work ethic not frequently seen in our industry and highly valued by my firm.

I must admit I am highly impressed by the LT browser and I am a tough guy to impress.; We use LambdaTest across our development & testing team. Our developers always perform cross browser tests on their local pages across different browsers and their versions before sending them to the testers. The integrations with 3rd party tools make it more useful. It provides a full development environment that looks very close to the real thing.Before we started using LambdaTest, we're limited to the browsers and their versions that are available on our desktops and laptops. But now with LambdaTest, we are using Selenium grid of 2000+ browsers and their versions available on the platform.If you want a solution to replace testing infrastructure that is hard to main and look after, LambdaTest is the best solution according to us.; Have been using Lambdatest for around 1 year now, and could say that it’s a useful testing tool for our team. Offering great combinations of browsers and operating systems for you to test on and most importantly there are many types of additional logs that come with each test which helps in debugging.. Glad to see the integration with Travis CI due to which we could optimally use this tool with our CI CD pipelines directly. We were able to effectively run TestNG and Selenium tests using their documentation and as an added advantage their support team is quick and helpful.; The industry we function (e-commerce) has a broad category of audience. We need to make sure our website is accessible to everyone irrespective of the browser / operating system they use. Ofcourse, responsive web design check is a major bullet point over our testing checklist as well. As a B2C, it's crucial for us to stay ahead of the customers and we wanted a solution which could help us ensure our changes would work seamlessly when shipped to the Production. LambdaTest made a great fit here when considered the latest browsers on the product, ability to test local pages along with a complimentary access to LT browser which is an absolute delight for our developers and testers. It helps us save a considerable effort on responsive testing plus the native developer tools allow us to dig deep into any UI mismatch! Also As mentioned we could achieve wider test coverage in time by running multiple combinations of browsers in parallel with LambdaTest automation suite. Our director to purchase the subscription was due to their affordable pricing for the parallel tests and the communication from the support team!; Running tests serially can be a good option when your product is at an early stage. But as we scaled the product, we needed a tool to reduce test time execution and pace up our test cycles. LambdaTest simplified the Selenium testing experience for us with their cloud based platform which allowed us to execute our test cases in parallel on hundreds of browsers. We could easily automate the test cases, get the sessions recorded and share the test reports across the team for assessment using Asana integration. We even leverage the integration with CircleCI to run automated tests on LambdaTest through our pipeline. The CircleCI Orb is handy for testing our privately hosted application.It’s good to see now that using LambdaTest we could run multiple tests on multiple VM’s, saving us hours of testing time and maintenance cost of local infrastructure. Personally, one thing that LambdaTest does very well is continuing to provide tutorials for testing, so that we stay up to speed and are even able to learn new things.I definitely saw myself applying a lot of the new concepts that I learned from their blogs.; As technology advances, enterprises are switching from manual testing to Selenium Test Automation. But one area most enterprises are still struggling is with the scalability of running several tests in parallel. LambdaTest has been a boon for us when it comes to Selenium automation. With a Selenium Grid based on the cloud, we don't need to stress about setting up and maintaining infrastructure anymore. We can run hundreds of tests in parallel on 2000+ browsers and OS versions running on real machines. LambdaTest really helped us in reducing our web testing cost and at the same time scale it as and when required.To leverage on marketing campaigns, we needed to ensure all our deliverables render seamlessly on different mobile and desktop browsers our users use to view them from across the world. The geolocation testing functionality helped us set the location and test our website over various locations. At LambdaTest, we can now run geolocation testing to test our website across 40+ countries. The pricing plan is pretty simple and easy to grasp, with no hidden costs at all.; We needed a testing tool that was scalable enough to cover all the browsers and OS as per our clients requirement and at the same time integrate well into our workflow. Lambdatest provided us with the necessary features to meet our browser compatibility testing requirements. Without any hassle of configuring, installing or maintaining the virtual machines, we are able to launch local browser tests instantly. The best part is, Lambdatest also helps us run our Selenium based automated tests on its cloud infra - that too without burning a hole in our pocket. They offer extensive mobile and desktop browsers, thereby increasing our test coverage to maximum.; We serve a variety of clients across industries, thus we need to make sure our website is accessible from every desktop, mobile browser combination they use. Responsive web design is an integral part of our testing process. As a B2B, you want to make sure that your services are always a step ahead of your customers. And to achieve that, it's important to have a tool that keeps your code and web designing process in sync with the Production.LambdaTest's variety of browsers and local testing capabilities made it a perfect fit for our requirements. Additionally we got free access to LT Browser which is absolutely loved by our developers. We are now in a better position while tackling misbehaving websites with the help of it’s inbuilt dev tools. The best part is that LambdaTest offers an automated parallel testing that helped us achieve faster and wider test coverage over multiple browsers. Its affordable price and fast technical support made the purchase decision very easy for the team. And yes I absolutely love their support staff. They are truly available for 24*7.; While we develop our web applications, our top concern was to verify the unintentional changes to the application's visuals. We need to make sure that changing one component doesn't break the styling of another component. LambdaTest's Smart testing helped us to identify visual regression bugs for every new build. We could capture our website screenshots belonging to different environments i.e stage and production & upload them on the LambdaTest Visual Testing platform. We were able to discover visual deviations with pixel to pixel comparison by capturing screenshots, comparing them against the baseline image, and highlighting visual changes. The slider mode is very helpful to compare the visual discrepancies between the two images by toggling them. Overall, Smart testing helped us perform reliable visual testing at scale and eliminated the risk of delivering visual bugs."
Serverspace,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2019,"First of all I would like to thank Serverspace for this great platform! Out of other VPS services, this is my favorite, it offers me the flexibility to enhance my skills as a Full-Stack Developer as well as a server administrator. Well out of frustrations from other VPS services, since they have a lot of hassle to work on, this platform enabled me to easily pick my choice, add new memory capability just by a few clicks. I observed the great UI/UX of this platform, and I am planning to use this forever until this platform is still working.; I tried many cloud server providers like AWS, Azure, Google cloud and more but they didn't satisfy my needs but when I tried Serverspace I was shocked because of their server prices, for a startup that will be the best option, I saw that the price is low but the service is best as expensive, I am fully satisfied with this. I recommend Serverspace for startups once a time you see, a cybercriminal attacked my server in serverspace but... the company has reported me on time, so I saved my server from further attacks, Serverspace saved a lot of time and money.; What I like about this company is the many options offered to us customers since I'm a Windows/Linux User and most of my needs rely on multi-OS systems. That's why I run 4 servers with ServerSpace. Their Windows Machines are as good as you can imagine, they offer all the alternatives I need, and I also run servers with CentOS. With Serverspace, I can cover all my needs for my business, and the best part is I also have different options on the payment side. They only charge me for the current use and not a whole monthly amount in advance, and I can cancel any server I ordered at any second. Also, their support tickets get answered right away. It's pretty good. What I think they could do better is improve their automatic system detecting payments with Ever. Every time I pay with Ever, I have to send a support ticket with transaction ID and all info about the payment to add funds. I get a reply the same day, but I'd rather not have to notify it. I'm very happy with this service, and I'll; I tried six to seven cloud services before I settled with Serverspace. I am glad that I found it. All I need was a reliable, scalable, economical, and user-friendly server for my data crunching and web application. First, their pricing is way attractive. The bigger sites may start with some low teaser rates or even free credits, but their prices go up exponentially with more CPU and memory. Serverspace's pricing remains very reasonable. Granted they don't offer super big servers, I don't need them either. The other thing I like is that they charge significantly less when you turn off the server while other sites charge you the same. I like their simple offers; simple servers that let me build my own environments. The plethora of bells and whistles elsewhere turn me off. Their servers are generally reliable except they failed to turn on a couple of times. But they fixed it promptly and were responsive through the process. Their clean and intuitive web UI is helpful.; I work most of the time but I also trade forex to make some extra money. Since I am not always at home, I had to get an expert advisor for my trades and that was when I started looking for a reliable VPS service. I have been using Serverspace VPS for less than a year now and I can say it has been a peaceful experience in the sense that I never had to worry about shutting down of the server. It's very pocket-friendly and I like that I can pay daily as I use it. What I enjoy most is the option to shutdown a server without deleting or destroying it completely, that way I can restart the server when I need it and continue using it. Like I said, you only get charged for what you use. For a little fee, you also have the option to increase the size or speed of a VPS server if your work becomes bigger without having to get a new server. I can only hope to get more than 50 Mbps speed for the fixed plan as it takes more time to work when everything is so slow.; I have been using Serverspace for about 6 months now. System performance is good. I have never used a VPS before, so I need some help getting up and running. Support always answers back thru a support ticket, although you may have to wait up to 6 hours sometimes, the support is good. Their pricing has been great, and I plan to stay with the service.; Before I decided to use their servers to host our services, I checked out and tried many alternatives. Some time ago I found Serverspace at some offers comparer and I decided to give it a try and I'm really satisfied. There are no problems with servers which I met using servers from others. So at the moment, I think I will use Serverspace servers for my other projects and initiatives.; I like Serverspace! The relation between the purchase price and the performance is perfect. I like dealing with you because of the cheap prices and high performance. Also, the support team is fast, I always get my tickets resolved as fast as possible. The deployment of services is also fast. In general, I do have a good experience and would like to build a long-term relationship.; The uptime and the speed of the service are fantastic. The quality of support is second to none. Every time I need help, I get a very personalized answer and they always go the extra mile to solve my problem. I have tried many competitors in the past but none of them come close to the quality of service I am getting in Serverspace."

After interviewing multiple (8) companies, I selected Alliancetek because they were experienced, offered end to end solutions beyond a standard mobile app firm, and their price point was below competing firms.Alliancetek delivered on all promises with great professionalism. We had to pivot several times in the course of the project and each hurdle was handled without a hitch. My “team” consisted of 3 Alliancetek employees (1 project manager, 1 iOS developer, 1 Android developer) who I spoke with weekly through Microsoft Team meetings.

Since development of the site, we've had clients ask for increased personalization and customization, and AllianceTek has been able to help us develop these in an expedient and efficient manner.

They don't use templates as standard, so could custom built to match my vision and created a website set-up that was completely bespoke to my needs.2.

LambdaTest,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2017,"Being a developer, responsive testing comes as a part of the package, every time I develop a webpage. I have been relying over LambdaTest for responsive testing. They have a feature which allows me to capture full page screenshots of my webpages in scores of different devices. I could even capture web pages that are locally hosted. And now, they have come up with a browser that lets me not only capture screenshots but interact with my websites in 25+ different devices, in a side by side view. That allows me to test my website responsiveness on a bunch of devices in a live-interactive manner. I must admit I am highly impressed by the LT browser and I am a tough guy to impress.; We use LambdaTest across our development & testing team. Our developers always perform cross browser tests on their local pages across different browsers and their versions before sending them to the testers. The integrations with 3rd party tools make it more useful. It provides a full development environment that looks very close to the real thing.Before we started using LambdaTest, we're limited to the browsers and their versions that are available on our desktops and laptops. But now with LambdaTest, we are using Selenium grid of 2000+ browsers and their versions available on the platform.If you want a solution to replace testing infrastructure that is hard to main and look after, LambdaTest is the best solution according to us.; Have been using Lambdatest for around 1 year now, and could say that it’s a useful testing tool for our team. Offering great combinations of browsers and operating systems for you to test on and most importantly there are many types of additional logs that come with each test which helps in debugging.. Glad to see the integration with Travis CI due to which we could optimally use this tool with our CI CD pipelines directly. We were able to effectively run TestNG and Selenium tests using their documentation and as an added advantage their support team is quick and helpful.; The industry we function (e-commerce) has a broad category of audience. We need to make sure our website is accessible to everyone irrespective of the browser / operating system they use. Ofcourse, responsive web design check is a major bullet point over our testing checklist as well. As a B2C, it's crucial for us to stay ahead of the customers and we wanted a solution which could help us ensure our changes would work seamlessly when shipped to the Production. LambdaTest made a great fit here when considered the latest browsers on the product, ability to test local pages along with a complimentary access to LT browser which is an absolute delight for our developers and testers. It helps us save a considerable effort on responsive testing plus the native developer tools allow us to dig deep into any UI mismatch! Also As mentioned we could achieve wider test coverage in time by running multiple combinations of browsers in parallel with LambdaTest automation suite. Our director to purchase the subscription was due to their affordable pricing for the parallel tests and the communication from the support team!; Running tests serially can be a good option when your product is at an early stage. But as we scaled the product, we needed a tool to reduce test time execution and pace up our test cycles. LambdaTest simplified the Selenium testing experience for us with their cloud based platform which allowed us to execute our test cases in parallel on hundreds of browsers. We could easily automate the test cases, get the sessions recorded and share the test reports across the team for assessment using Asana integration. We even leverage the integration with CircleCI to run automated tests on LambdaTest through our pipeline. The CircleCI Orb is handy for testing our privately hosted application.It’s good to see now that using LambdaTest we could run multiple tests on multiple VM’s, saving us hours of testing time and maintenance cost of local infrastructure. Personally, one thing that LambdaTest does very well is continuing to provide tutorials for testing, so that we stay up to speed and are even able to learn new things.I definitely saw myself applying a lot of the new concepts that I learned from their blogs.; As technology advances, enterprises are switching from manual testing to Selenium Test Automation. But one area most enterprises are still struggling is with the scalability of running several tests in parallel. LambdaTest has been a boon for us when it comes to Selenium automation. With a Selenium Grid based on the cloud, we don't need to stress about setting up and maintaining infrastructure anymore. We can run hundreds of tests in parallel on 2000+ browsers and OS versions running on real machines. LambdaTest really helped us in reducing our web testing cost and at the same time scale it as and when required.To leverage on marketing campaigns, we needed to ensure all our deliverables render seamlessly on different mobile and desktop browsers our users use to view them from across the world. The geolocation testing functionality helped us set the location and test our website over various locations. At LambdaTest, we can now run geolocation testing to test our website across 40+ countries. The pricing plan is pretty simple and easy to grasp, with no hidden costs at all.; We needed a testing tool that was scalable enough to cover all the browsers and OS as per our clients requirement and at the same time integrate well into our workflow. Lambdatest provided us with the necessary features to meet our browser compatibility testing requirements. Without any hassle of configuring, installing or maintaining the virtual machines, we are able to launch local browser tests instantly. The best part is, Lambdatest also helps us run our Selenium based automated tests on its cloud infra - that too without burning a hole in our pocket. They offer extensive mobile and desktop browsers, thereby increasing our test coverage to maximum.; We serve a variety of clients across industries, thus we need to make sure our website is accessible from every desktop, mobile browser combination they use. Responsive web design is an integral part of our testing process. As a B2B, you want to make sure that your services are always a step ahead of your customers. And to achieve that, it's important to have a tool that keeps your code and web designing process in sync with the Production.LambdaTest's variety of browsers and local testing capabilities made it a perfect fit for our requirements. Additionally we got free access to LT Browser which is absolutely loved by our developers. We are now in a better position while tackling misbehaving websites with the help of it’s inbuilt dev tools. The best part is that LambdaTest offers an automated parallel testing that helped us achieve faster and wider test coverage over multiple browsers. Its affordable price and fast technical support made the purchase decision very easy for the team. And yes I absolutely love their support staff. They are truly available for 24*7.; While we develop our web applications, our top concern was to verify the unintentional changes to the application's visuals. We need to make sure that changing one component doesn't break the styling of another component. LambdaTest's Smart testing helped us to identify visual regression bugs for every new build. We could capture our website screenshots belonging to different environments i.e stage and production & upload them on the LambdaTest Visual Testing platform. We were able to discover visual deviations with pixel to pixel comparison by capturing screenshots, comparing them against the baseline image, and highlighting visual changes. The slider mode is very helpful to compare the visual discrepancies between the two images by toggling them. Overall, Smart testing helped us perform reliable visual testing at scale and eliminated the risk of delivering visual bugs."
Serverspace,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2019,"First of all I would like to thank Serverspace for this great platform! Out of other VPS services, this is my favorite, it offers me the flexibility to enhance my skills as a Full-Stack Developer as well as a server administrator. Well out of frustrations from other VPS services, since they have a lot of hassle to work on, this platform enabled me to easily pick my choice, add new memory capability just by a few clicks. I observed the great UI/UX of this platform, and I am planning to use this forever until this platform is still working.; I tried many cloud server providers like AWS, Azure, Google cloud and more but they didn't satisfy my needs but when I tried Serverspace I was shocked because of their server prices, for a startup that will be the best option, I saw that the price is low but the service is best as expensive, I am fully satisfied with this. I recommend Serverspace for startups once a time you see, a cybercriminal attacked my server in serverspace but... the company has reported me on time, so I saved my server from further attacks, Serverspace saved a lot of time and money.; What I like about this company is the many options offered to us customers since I'm a Windows/Linux User and most of my needs rely on multi-OS systems. That's why I run 4 servers with ServerSpace. Their Windows Machines are as good as you can imagine, they offer all the alternatives I need, and I also run servers with CentOS. With Serverspace, I can cover all my needs for my business, and the best part is I also have different options on the payment side. They only charge me for the current use and not a whole monthly amount in advance, and I can cancel any server I ordered at any second. Also, their support tickets get answered right away. It's pretty good. What I think they could do better is improve their automatic system detecting payments with Ever. Every time I pay with Ever, I have to send a support ticket with transaction ID and all info about the payment to add funds. I get a reply the same day, but I'd rather not have to notify it. I'm very happy with this service, and I'll; I tried six to seven cloud services before I settled with Serverspace. I am glad that I found it. All I need was a reliable, scalable, economical, and user-friendly server for my data crunching and web application. First, their pricing is way attractive. The bigger sites may start with some low teaser rates or even free credits, but their prices go up exponentially with more CPU and memory. Serverspace's pricing remains very reasonable. Granted they don't offer super big servers, I don't need them either. The other thing I like is that they charge significantly less when you turn off the server while other sites charge you the same. I like their simple offers; simple servers that let me build my own environments. The plethora of bells and whistles elsewhere turn me off. Their servers are generally reliable except they failed to turn on a couple of times. But they fixed it promptly and were responsive through the process. Their clean and intuitive web UI is helpful.; I work most of the time but I also trade forex to make some extra money. Since I am not always at home, I had to get an expert advisor for my trades and that was when I started looking for a reliable VPS service. I have been using Serverspace VPS for less than a year now and I can say it has been a peaceful experience in the sense that I never had to worry about shutting down of the server. It's very pocket-friendly and I like that I can pay daily as I use it. What I enjoy most is the option to shutdown a server without deleting or destroying it completely, that way I can restart the server when I need it and continue using it. Like I said, you only get charged for what you use. For a little fee, you also have the option to increase the size or speed of a VPS server if your work becomes bigger without having to get a new server. I can only hope to get more than 50 Mbps speed for the fixed plan as it takes more time to work when everything is so slow.; I have been using Serverspace for about 6 months now. System performance is good. I have never used a VPS before, so I need some help getting up and running. Support always answers back thru a support ticket, although you may have to wait up to 6 hours sometimes, the support is good. Their pricing has been great, and I plan to stay with the service.; Before I decided to use their servers to host our services, I checked out and tried many alternatives. Some time ago I found Serverspace at some offers comparer and I decided to give it a try and I'm really satisfied. There are no problems with servers which I met using servers from others. So at the moment, I think I will use Serverspace servers for my other projects and initiatives.; I like Serverspace! The relation between the purchase price and the performance is perfect. I like dealing with you because of the cheap prices and high performance. Also, the support team is fast, I always get my tickets resolved as fast as possible. The deployment of services is also fast. In general, I do have a good experience and would like to build a long-term relationship.; The uptime and the speed of the service are fantastic. The quality of support is second to none. Every time I need help, I get a very personalized answer and they always go the extra mile to solve my problem. I have tried many competitors in the past but none of them come close to the quality of service I am getting in Serverspace."

After interviewing multiple (8) companies, I selected Alliancetek because they were experienced, offered end to end solutions beyond a standard mobile app firm, and their price point was below competing firms.Alliancetek delivered on all promises with great professionalism. We had to pivot several times in the course of the project and each hurdle was handled without a hitch. My “team” consisted of 3 Alliancetek employees (1 project manager, 1 iOS developer, 1 Android developer) who I spoke with weekly through Microsoft Team meetings. There were additional back end developers who worked on the project. I had an outstanding experience and give Alliancetek my highest recommendation.; My company was close to the launch date for a software platform that allows aspiring US college athletes to get recruited. It was a complex system involving many different elements, user types and features. With our primary in-house developer, we were running very late on our development schedule. We had a few months left to finish off the system before our customers began to use it. We brought AllianceTek on and they helped us get over the line with their amazing, responsive and high quality work. Without their tremendous work, we would not have been able to get over the line and give our customers a product that would be helpful to them. AllianceTek were honestly a game changer, and I could not imagine being where we are today as a company without their heavy and continued involvement.; The project has moved extremely smooth. The communication, the Dev team, I mean all of you guys over at Alliance Tech have just blown away my expectations and I can't thank you guys enough for helping me bring this idea into a reality. This is going to, not just revolutionise the industry, but revolutionise sales training in general. it's going to be able to present different scenarios, to the training platform getting feedback and uploading their videos to train to where we can train hundreds of people at the same time. I mean guys, this software that you guys have helped bring to life is truly going to change the industry.; Sokolis Group has been working with AllianceTek for almost a decade. We partnered with them to design and build a proprietary application that is critical to our business for analyzing and reporting our clients' fuel transaction data. Over the years, we have continued to work with AllianceTek to develop new features which helped make our business more efficient and our reporting to clients more insightful. In addition, AllianceTek provides the hosting and maintenance for this cloud-based application and we trust them to handle this important responsibility. They are a valued partner to our business and I would not hesitate to recommend them.; I work for a boutique leadership and communication consulting firm. As part of our service offerings, we provide clients a private and secure performance / developmental review site where employees are able to provide one another feedback on a regular cadence. We initially used an internal site, but as the scale of our projects and clients began to increase, we knew we needed to increase the sophistication of our site. That's where AllianceTek came in. Working together hand-in-hand, we developed a site tailored to the needs of our clients. Since development of the site, we've had clients ask for increased personalization and customization, and AllianceTek has been able to help us develop these in an expedient and efficient manner. Another bonus is that even after several years of working together, we've had the same points of contact throughout. This has been an invaluable part of us working together so well. After the past few years of working together, I couldn't recommend AllianceTek highly enough.; ; AllianceTek has delivered outstanding products and services which has helped Strategas achieve outstanding recognition from our financial services clients. Beyond those technical achievements, what sets this team apart from the crowd is the rapid responsiveness to my requests, be it a production problem, coding change, or business challenge; that kind of responsiveness is an exceptional work ethic not frequently seen in our industry and highly valued by my firm. I can always count upon this team to respond in kind with their best efforts.; ; "

LambdaTest,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2017,"Being a developer, responsive testing comes as a part of the package, every time I develop a webpage. I have been relying over LambdaTest for responsive testing. They have a feature which allows me to capture full page screenshots of my webpages in scores of different devices. I could even capture web pages that are locally hosted. And now, they have come up with a browser that lets me not only capture screenshots but interact with my websites in 25+ different devices, in a side by side view. That allows me to test my website responsiveness on a bunch of devices in a live-interactive manner. I must admit I am highly impressed by the LT browser and I am a tough guy to impress.; We use LambdaTest across our development & testing team. Our developers always perform cross browser tests on their local pages across different browsers and their versions before sending them to the testers. The integrations with 3rd party tools make it more useful. It provides a full development environment that looks very close to the real thing.Before we started using LambdaTest, we're limited to the browsers and their versions that are available on our desktops and laptops. But now with LambdaTest, we are using Selenium grid of 2000+ browsers and their versions available on the platform.If you want a solution to replace testing infrastructure that is hard to main and look after, LambdaTest is the best solution according to us.; Have been using Lambdatest for around 1 year now, and could say that it’s a useful testing tool for our team. Offering great combinations of browsers and operating systems for you to test on and most importantly there are many types of additional logs that come with each test which helps in debugging.. Glad to see the integration with Travis CI due to which we could optimally use this tool with our CI CD pipelines directly. We were able to effectively run TestNG and Selenium tests using their documentation and as an added advantage their support team is quick and helpful.; The industry we function (e-commerce) has a broad category of audience. We need to make sure our website is accessible to everyone irrespective of the browser / operating system they use. Ofcourse, responsive web design check is a major bullet point over our testing checklist as well. As a B2C, it's crucial for us to stay ahead of the customers and we wanted a solution which could help us ensure our changes would work seamlessly when shipped to the Production. LambdaTest made a great fit here when considered the latest browsers on the product, ability to test local pages along with a complimentary access to LT browser which is an absolute delight for our developers and testers. It helps us save a considerable effort on responsive testing plus the native developer tools allow us to dig deep into any UI mismatch! Also As mentioned we could achieve wider test coverage in time by running multiple combinations of browsers in parallel with LambdaTest automation suite. Our director to purchase the subscription was due to their affordable pricing for the parallel tests and the communication from the support team!; Running tests serially can be a good option when your product is at an early stage. But as we scaled the product, we needed a tool to reduce test time execution and pace up our test cycles. LambdaTest simplified the Selenium testing experience for us with their cloud based platform which allowed us to execute our test cases in parallel on hundreds of browsers. We could easily automate the test cases, get the sessions recorded and share the test reports across the team for assessment using Asana integration. We even leverage the integration with CircleCI to run automated tests on LambdaTest through our pipeline. The CircleCI Orb is handy for testing our privately hosted application.It’s good to see now that using LambdaTest we could run multiple tests on multiple VM’s, saving us hours of testing time and maintenance cost of local infrastructure. Personally, one thing that LambdaTest does very well is continuing to provide tutorials for testing, so that we stay up to speed and are even able to learn new things.I definitely saw myself applying a lot of the new concepts that I learned from their blogs.; As technology advances, enterprises are switching from manual testing to Selenium Test Automation. But one area most enterprises are still struggling is with the scalability of running several tests in parallel. LambdaTest has been a boon for us when it comes to Selenium automation. With a Selenium Grid based on the cloud, we don't need to stress about setting up and maintaining infrastructure anymore. We can run hundreds of tests in parallel on 2000+ browsers and OS versions running on real machines. LambdaTest really helped us in reducing our web testing cost and at the same time scale it as and when required.To leverage on marketing campaigns, we needed to ensure all our deliverables render seamlessly on different mobile and desktop browsers our users use to view them from across the world. The geolocation testing functionality helped us set the location and test our website over various locations. At LambdaTest, we can now run geolocation testing to test our website across 40+ countries. The pricing plan is pretty simple and easy to grasp, with no hidden costs at all.; We needed a testing tool that was scalable enough to cover all the browsers and OS as per our clients requirement and at the same time integrate well into our workflow. Lambdatest provided us with the necessary features to meet our browser compatibility testing requirements. Without any hassle of configuring, installing or maintaining the virtual machines, we are able to launch local browser tests instantly. The best part is, Lambdatest also helps us run our Selenium based automated tests on its cloud infra - that too without burning a hole in our pocket. They offer extensive mobile and desktop browsers, thereby increasing our test coverage to maximum.; We serve a variety of clients across industries, thus we need to make sure our website is accessible from every desktop, mobile browser combination they use. Responsive web design is an integral part of our testing process. As a B2B, you want to make sure that your services are always a step ahead of your customers. And to achieve that, it's important to have a tool that keeps your code and web designing process in sync with the Production.LambdaTest's variety of browsers and local testing capabilities made it a perfect fit for our requirements. Additionally we got free access to LT Browser which is absolutely loved by our developers. We are now in a better position while tackling misbehaving websites with the help of it’s inbuilt dev tools. The best part is that LambdaTest offers an automated parallel testing that helped us achieve faster and wider test coverage over multiple browsers. Its affordable price and fast technical support made the purchase decision very easy for the team. And yes I absolutely love their support staff. They are truly available for 24*7.; While we develop our web applications, our top concern was to verify the unintentional changes to the application's visuals. We need to make sure that changing one component doesn't break the styling of another component. LambdaTest's Smart testing helped us to identify visual regression bugs for every new build. We could capture our website screenshots belonging to different environments i.e stage and production & upload them on the LambdaTest Visual Testing platform. We were able to discover visual deviations with pixel to pixel comparison by capturing screenshots, comparing them against the baseline image, and highlighting visual changes. The slider mode is very helpful to compare the visual discrepancies between the two images by toggling them. Overall, Smart testing helped us perform reliable visual testing at scale and eliminated the risk of delivering visual bugs."
Serverspace,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2019,"First of all I would like to thank Serverspace for this great platform! Out of other VPS services, this is my favorite, it offers me the flexibility to enhance my skills as a Full-Stack Developer as well as a server administrator. Well out of frustrations from other VPS services, since they have a lot of hassle to work on, this platform enabled me to easily pick my choice, add new memory capability just by a few clicks. I observed the great UI/UX of this platform, and I am planning to use this forever until this platform is still working.; I tried many cloud server providers like AWS, Azure, Google cloud and more but they didn't satisfy my needs but when I tried Serverspace I was shocked because of their server prices, for a startup that will be the best option, I saw that the price is low but the service is best as expensive, I am fully satisfied with this. I recommend Serverspace for startups once a time you see, a cybercriminal attacked my server in serverspace but... the company has reported me on time, so I saved my server from further attacks, Serverspace saved a lot of time and money.; What I like about this company is the many options offered to us customers since I'm a Windows/Linux User and most of my needs rely on multi-OS systems. That's why I run 4 servers with ServerSpace. Their Windows Machines are as good as you can imagine, they offer all the alternatives I need, and I also run servers with CentOS. With Serverspace, I can cover all my needs for my business, and the best part is I also have different options on the payment side. They only charge me for the current use and not a whole monthly amount in advance, and I can cancel any server I ordered at any second. Also, their support tickets get answered right away. It's pretty good. What I think they could do better is improve their automatic system detecting payments with Ever. Every time I pay with Ever, I have to send a support ticket with transaction ID and all info about the payment to add funds. I get a reply the same day, but I'd rather not have to notify it. I'm very happy with this service, and I'll; I tried six to seven cloud services before I settled with Serverspace. I am glad that I found it. All I need was a reliable, scalable, economical, and user-friendly server for my data crunching and web application. First, their pricing is way attractive. The bigger sites may start with some low teaser rates or even free credits, but their prices go up exponentially with more CPU and memory. Serverspace's pricing remains very reasonable. Granted they don't offer super big servers, I don't need them either. The other thing I like is that they charge significantly less when you turn off the server while other sites charge you the same. I like their simple offers; simple servers that let me build my own environments. The plethora of bells and whistles elsewhere turn me off. Their servers are generally reliable except they failed to turn on a couple of times. But they fixed it promptly and were responsive through the process. Their clean and intuitive web UI is helpful.; I work most of the time but I also trade forex to make some extra money. Since I am not always at home, I had to get an expert advisor for my trades and that was when I started looking for a reliable VPS service. I have been using Serverspace VPS for less than a year now and I can say it has been a peaceful experience in the sense that I never had to worry about shutting down of the server. It's very pocket-friendly and I like that I can pay daily as I use it. What I enjoy most is the option to shutdown a server without deleting or destroying it completely, that way I can restart the server when I need it and continue using it. Like I said, you only get charged for what you use. For a little fee, you also have the option to increase the size or speed of a VPS server if your work becomes bigger without having to get a new server. I can only hope to get more than 50 Mbps speed for the fixed plan as it takes more time to work when everything is so slow.; I have been using Serverspace for about 6 months now. System performance is good. I have never used a VPS before, so I need some help getting up and running. Support always answers back thru a support ticket, although you may have to wait up to 6 hours sometimes, the support is good. Their pricing has been great, and I plan to stay with the service.; Before I decided to use their servers to host our services, I checked out and tried many alternatives. Some time ago I found Serverspace at some offers comparer and I decided to give it a try and I'm really satisfied. There are no problems with servers which I met using servers from others. So at the moment, I think I will use Serverspace servers for my other projects and initiatives.; I like Serverspace! The relation between the purchase price and the performance is perfect. I like dealing with you because of the cheap prices and high performance. Also, the support team is fast, I always get my tickets resolved as fast as possible. The deployment of services is also fast. In general, I do have a good experience and would like to build a long-term relationship.; The uptime and the speed of the service are fantastic. The quality of support is second to none. Every time I need help, I get a very personalized answer and they always go the extra mile to solve my problem. I have tried many competitors in the past but none of them come close to the quality of service I am getting in Serverspace."

MetaDesign worked with us throughout the process, providing recommendations on best practices, prototyping, development, and testing. They set up a cloud environment and provide a hosted solution including support on an ongoing basis. We had a team lead who worked with us directly and other developers as needed. We use the software on a daily basis in connection with our production process. It reliably performs exactly the function we need it to perform.Our team lead is responsive and available, reliably delivering work products on time. MetaDesign is responsive, they know what to do and they do what they say they are going to do!We are very satisfied with MetaDesign.; I have been working with MetaDesign Solutions for many years now and I can confidently say that this is one of the best companies that I've ever come across. The team is very professional and responsive, they work hard to understand the vision of their clients, and they provide excellent quality. They also help me design my app in a cost-effective manner. I highly recommend MetaDesign Solutions to anyone who needs an app or software development company; Have worked with Metadesign on multiple projects for more than 5 years now. They have a wide range of skills and keep themselves current with new technologies and approaches, so they have been able to meet our evolving needs for tech development. They have end-to-end capability and in a couple of cases they are the technology arm of my organization. They are very transparent in all their communications and interactions. So I have never been blindsighted by a key resource resigning for example. Would certainly recommend them to others; I highly recommend Amit and his team to anyone looking for a knowledgeable developer who is easy to work with and can quickly build a sophisticated scalable product. Throughout the development process, they became part of my team and were extremely proactive in tweaking and improving the product based on customer feedback.

It was a pleasure working with them and highly recommend them to everyone.; We decided to work with MetaDesign Solutions for our project as we found their offer appealing as well as affordable, especially considering our requirements.

Codebay,cloud-computing-companies,"
$25 - $49/hr ",2014,"Once the first part of the project was released it was a considerable change, we eliminated manual records in the inventories and we managed to digitize our product information.And something that we did not consider, but had a positive impact, was sending everything to the cloud, when the pandemic hit we were forced to close the offices, so since everything was digital, the administrative functions, new orders, registrations and among others, were not seen affected.; There is constant communication, during the project there is a general review every three weeks; also, we had daily meetings to define activities, which allowed us to have a very quick response to any issue with the platform.Although the project was not without delays, these were minimal and were quickly corrected. The final project was delivered and implemented without major complications. Currently the Codebay team provides us with support and system updates.; We hire them for the development of a web application. A member of their team, Luis Sanchez was in charge of the project, we had several meetings to define the content and structure of the first sites. Later, he presented us graphic proposals and based on this, they began to develop. During development there were adjustments; Comparing them with the company I had worked with before, their communications are way superior. I always know exactly what they're working on, specifically the stage of the process where they're at. In addition, they're always upfront whenever things might take longer than expected. However, for the most part, they've completed things in a timely manner or even ahead of schedule.; We started working with a cloud specialist, who reviewed our current systems and implemented a work plan to migrate to the cloud. The process did not take that long, but we had complications migrating the information as our old servers were constantly crashing due to the workload. Eventually we managed to migrate everything, and from there Codebay has provided us with maintenance services.; We start by planning the different stages of development with the support of an architect and the design area. We already had a system made in .NET, so the new platform was programmed in the same language. The development had different variables which took a year to complete, currently we continue working with them with support and system improvements.; We have worked together for a few months and it has been a positive experience, the team besides being very committed to development, they have shown good technical skills. The management team has been aware of any issue and has been very open to follow up on doubts.; Codebay has served as the supporting development team for a startup incubation university.

$25 - $49/hr ",2004,"We are a startup fintech company and needed to develop a mobile app in iOS and Android. The app is a social media platform for investing with back end analytics similar to Twitter. The development required integration with a high end data provider and a separate charting platform. After interviewing multiple (8) companies, I selected Alliancetek because they were experienced, offered end to end solutions beyond a standard mobile app firm, and their price point was below competing firms.Alliancetek delivered on all promises with great professionalism. We had to pivot several times in the course of the project and each hurdle was handled without a hitch. My “team” consisted of 3 Alliancetek employees (1 project manager, 1 iOS developer, 1 Android developer) who I spoke with weekly through Microsoft Team meetings. There were additional back end developers who worked on the project. I had an outstanding experience and give Alliancetek my highest recommendation.; My company was close to the launch date for a software platform that allows aspiring US college athletes to get recruited. It was a complex system involving many different elements, user types and features. With our primary in-house developer, we were running very late on our development schedule. We had a few months left to finish off the system before our customers began to use it. We brought AllianceTek on and they helped us get over the line with their amazing, responsive and high quality work. Without their tremendous work, we would not have been able to get over the line and give our customers a product that would be helpful to them. AllianceTek were honestly a game changer, and I could not imagine being where we are today as a company without their heavy and continued involvement.; The project has moved extremely smooth. The communication, the Dev team, I mean all of you guys over at Alliance Tech have just blown away my expectations and I can't thank you guys enough for helping me bring this idea into a reality. This is going to, not just revolutionise the industry, but revolutionise sales training in general. it's going to be able to present different scenarios, to the training platform getting feedback and uploading their videos to train to where we can train hundreds of people at the same time. I mean guys, this software that you guys have helped bring to life is truly going to change the industry.; Sokolis Group has been working with AllianceTek for almost a decade. We partnered with them to design and build a proprietary application that is critical to our business for analyzing and reporting our clients' fuel transaction data. Over the years, we have continued to work with AllianceTek to develop new features which helped make our business more efficient and our reporting to clients more insightful. In addition, AllianceTek provides the hosting and maintenance for this cloud-based application and we trust them to handle this important responsibility. They are a valued partner to our business and I would not hesitate to recommend them.; I work for a boutique leadership and communication consulting firm. As part of our service offerings, we provide clients a private and secure performance / developmental review site where employees are able to provide one another feedback on a regular cadence. We initially used an internal site, but as the scale of our projects and clients began to increase, we knew we needed to increase the sophistication of our site. That's where AllianceTek came in. Working together hand-in-hand, we developed a site tailored to the needs of our clients. Since development of the site, we've had clients ask for increased personalization and customization, and AllianceTek has been able to help us develop these in an expedient and efficient manner. Another bonus is that even after several years of working together, we've had the same points of contact throughout. This has been an invaluable part of us working together so well. After the past few years of working together, I couldn't recommend AllianceTek highly enough.; ; AllianceTek has delivered outstanding products and services which has helped Strategas achieve outstanding recognition from our financial services clients. Beyond those technical achievements, what sets this team apart from the crowd is the rapid responsiveness to my requests, be it a production problem, coding change, or business challenge; that kind of responsiveness is an exceptional work ethic not frequently seen in our industry and highly valued by my firm. I can always count upon this team to respond in kind with their best efforts.; ; "

LambdaTest,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2017,"Being a developer, responsive testing comes as a part of the package, every time I develop a webpage. I have been relying over LambdaTest for responsive testing. They have a feature which allows me to capture full page screenshots of my webpages in scores of different devices. I could even capture web pages that are locally hosted. And now, they have come up with a browser that lets me not only capture screenshots but interact with my websites in 25+ different devices, in a side by side view. That allows me to test my website responsiveness on a bunch of devices in a live-interactive manner. I must admit I am highly impressed by the LT browser and I am a tough guy to impress.; We use LambdaTest across our development & testing team. Our developers always perform cross browser tests on their local pages across different browsers and their versions before sending them to the testers. The integrations with 3rd party tools make it more useful. It provides a full development environment that looks very close to the real thing.Before we started using LambdaTest, we're limited to the browsers and their versions that are available on our desktops and laptops. But now with LambdaTest, we are using Selenium grid of 2000+ browsers and their versions available on the platform.If you want a solution to replace testing infrastructure that is hard to main and look after, LambdaTest is the best solution according to us.; Have been using Lambdatest for around 1 year now, and could say that it’s a useful testing tool for our team. Offering great combinations of browsers and operating systems for you to test on and most importantly there are many types of additional logs that come with each test which helps in debugging.. Glad to see the integration with Travis CI due to which we could optimally use this tool with our CI CD pipelines directly. We were able to effectively run TestNG and Selenium tests using their documentation and as an added advantage their support team is quick and helpful.; The industry we function (e-commerce) has a broad category of audience. We need to make sure our website is accessible to everyone irrespective of the browser / operating system they use. Ofcourse, responsive web design check is a major bullet point over our testing checklist as well. As a B2C, it's crucial for us to stay ahead of the customers and we wanted a solution which could help us ensure our changes would work seamlessly when shipped to the Production. LambdaTest made a great fit here when considered the latest browsers on the product, ability to test local pages along with a complimentary access to LT browser which is an absolute delight for our developers and testers. It helps us save a considerable effort on responsive testing plus the native developer tools allow us to dig deep into any UI mismatch! Also As mentioned we could achieve wider test coverage in time by running multiple combinations of browsers in parallel with LambdaTest automation suite. Our director to purchase the subscription was due to their affordable pricing for the parallel tests and the communication from the support team!; Running tests serially can be a good option when your product is at an early stage. But as we scaled the product, we needed a tool to reduce test time execution and pace up our test cycles. LambdaTest simplified the Selenium testing experience for us with their cloud based platform which allowed us to execute our test cases in parallel on hundreds of browsers. We could easily automate the test cases, get the sessions recorded and share the test reports across the team for assessment using Asana integration. We even leverage the integration with CircleCI to run automated tests on LambdaTest through our pipeline. The CircleCI Orb is handy for testing our privately hosted application.It’s good to see now that using LambdaTest we could run multiple tests on multiple VM’s, saving us hours of testing time and maintenance cost of local infrastructure. Personally, one thing that LambdaTest does very well is continuing to provide tutorials for testing, so that we stay up to speed and are even able to learn new things.I definitely saw myself applying a lot of the new concepts that I learned from their blogs.; As technology advances, enterprises are switching from manual testing to Selenium Test Automation. But one area most enterprises are still struggling is with the scalability of running several tests in parallel. LambdaTest has been a boon for us when it comes to Selenium automation. With a Selenium Grid based on the cloud, we don't need to stress about setting up and maintaining infrastructure anymore. We can run hundreds of tests in parallel on 2000+ browsers and OS versions running on real machines. LambdaTest really helped us in reducing our web testing cost and at the same time scale it as and when required.To leverage on marketing campaigns, we needed to ensure all our deliverables render seamlessly on different mobile and desktop browsers our users use to view them from across the world. The geolocation testing functionality helped us set the location and test our website over various locations. At LambdaTest, we can now run geolocation testing to test our website across 40+ countries. The pricing plan is pretty simple and easy to grasp, with no hidden costs at all.; We needed a testing tool that was scalable enough to cover all the browsers and OS as per our clients requirement and at the same time integrate well into our workflow. Lambdatest provided us with the necessary features to meet our browser compatibility testing requirements. Without any hassle of configuring, installing or maintaining the virtual machines, we are able to launch local browser tests instantly. The best part is, Lambdatest also helps us run our Selenium based automated tests on its cloud infra - that too without burning a hole in our pocket. They offer extensive mobile and desktop browsers, thereby increasing our test coverage to maximum.; We serve a variety of clients across industries, thus we need to make sure our website is accessible from every desktop, mobile browser combination they use. Responsive web design is an integral part of our testing process. As a B2B, you want to make sure that your services are always a step ahead of your customers. And to achieve that, it's important to have a tool that keeps your code and web designing process in sync with the Production.LambdaTest's variety of browsers and local testing capabilities made it a perfect fit for our requirements. Additionally we got free access to LT Browser which is absolutely loved by our developers. We are now in a better position while tackling misbehaving websites with the help of it’s inbuilt dev tools. The best part is that LambdaTest offers an automated parallel testing that helped us achieve faster and wider test coverage over multiple browsers. Its affordable price and fast technical support made the purchase decision very easy for the team. And yes I absolutely love their support staff. They are truly available for 24*7.; While we develop our web applications, our top concern was to verify the unintentional changes to the application's visuals. We need to make sure that changing one component doesn't break the styling of another component. LambdaTest's Smart testing helped us to identify visual regression bugs for every new build. We could capture our website screenshots belonging to different environments i.e stage and production & upload them on the LambdaTest Visual Testing platform. We were able to discover visual deviations with pixel to pixel comparison by capturing screenshots, comparing them against the baseline image, and highlighting visual changes. The slider mode is very helpful to compare the visual discrepancies between the two images by toggling them. Overall, Smart testing helped us perform reliable visual testing at scale and eliminated the risk of delivering visual bugs."
Serverspace,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2019,"First of all I would like to thank Serverspace for this great platform! Out of other VPS services, this is my favorite, it offers me the flexibility to enhance my skills as a Full-Stack Developer as well as a server administrator. Well out of frustrations from other VPS services, since they have a lot of hassle to work on, this platform enabled me to easily pick my choice, add new memory capability just by a few clicks. I observed the great UI/UX of this platform, and I am planning to use this forever until this platform is still working.; I tried many cloud server providers like AWS, Azure, Google cloud and more but they didn't satisfy my needs but when I tried Serverspace I was shocked because of their server prices, for a startup that will be the best option, I saw that the price is low but the service is best as expensive, I am fully satisfied with this. I recommend Serverspace for startups once a time you see, a cybercriminal attacked my server in serverspace but... the company has reported me on time, so I saved my server from further attacks, Serverspace saved a lot of time and money.; What I like about this company is the many options offered to us customers since I'm a Windows/Linux User and most of my needs rely on multi-OS systems. That's why I run 4 servers with ServerSpace. Their Windows Machines are as good as you can imagine, they offer all the alternatives I need, and I also run servers with CentOS. With Serverspace, I can cover all my needs for my business, and the best part is I also have different options on the payment side. They only charge me for the current use and not a whole monthly amount in advance, and I can cancel any server I ordered at any second. Also, their support tickets get answered right away. It's pretty good. What I think they could do better is improve their automatic system detecting payments with Ever. Every time I pay with Ever, I have to send a support ticket with transaction ID and all info about the payment to add funds. I get a reply the same day, but I'd rather not have to notify it. I'm very happy with this service, and I'll; I tried six to seven cloud services before I settled with Serverspace. I am glad that I found it. All I need was a reliable, scalable, economical, and user-friendly server for my data crunching and web application. First, their pricing is way attractive. The bigger sites may start with some low teaser rates or even free credits, but their prices go up exponentially with more CPU and memory. Serverspace's pricing remains very reasonable. Granted they don't offer super big servers, I don't need them either. The other thing I like is that they charge significantly less when you turn off the server while other sites charge you the same. I like their simple offers; simple servers that let me build my own environments. The plethora of bells and whistles elsewhere turn me off. Their servers are generally reliable except they failed to turn on a couple of times. But they fixed it promptly and were responsive through the process. Their clean and intuitive web UI is helpful.; I work most of the time but I also trade forex to make some extra money. Since I am not always at home, I had to get an expert advisor for my trades and that was when I started looking for a reliable VPS service. I have been using Serverspace VPS for less than a year now and I can say it has been a peaceful experience in the sense that I never had to worry about shutting down of the server. It's very pocket-friendly and I like that I can pay daily as I use it. What I enjoy most is the option to shutdown a server without deleting or destroying it completely, that way I can restart the server when I need it and continue using it. Like I said, you only get charged for what you use. For a little fee, you also have the option to increase the size or speed of a VPS server if your work becomes bigger without having to get a new server. I can only hope to get more than 50 Mbps speed for the fixed plan as it takes more time to work when everything is so slow.; I have been using Serverspace for about 6 months now. System performance is good. I have never used a VPS before, so I need some help getting up and running. Support always answers back thru a support ticket, although you may have to wait up to 6 hours sometimes, the support is good. Their pricing has been great, and I plan to stay with the service.; Before I decided to use their servers to host our services, I checked out and tried many alternatives. Some time ago I found Serverspace at some offers comparer and I decided to give it a try and I'm really satisfied. There are no problems with servers which I met using servers from others. So at the moment, I think I will use Serverspace servers for my other projects and initiatives.; I like Serverspace! The relation between the purchase price and the performance is perfect. I like dealing with you because of the cheap prices and high performance. Also, the support team is fast, I always get my tickets resolved as fast as possible. The deployment of services is also fast. In general, I do have a good experience and would like to build a long-term relationship.; The uptime and the speed of the service are fantastic. The quality of support is second to none. Every time I need help, I get a very personalized answer and they always go the extra mile to solve my problem.

The app is a social media platform for investing with back end analytics similar to Twitter. The development required integration with a high end data provider and a separate charting platform. After interviewing multiple (8) companies, I selected Alliancetek because they were experienced, offered end to end solutions beyond a standard mobile app firm, and their price point was below competing firms.Alliancetek delivered on all promises with great professionalism. We had to pivot several times in the course of the project and each hurdle was handled without a hitch. My “team” consisted of 3 Alliancetek employees (1 project manager, 1 iOS developer, 1 Android developer) who I spoke with weekly through Microsoft Team meetings. There were additional back end developers who worked on the project. I had an outstanding experience and give Alliancetek my highest recommendation.; My company was close to the launch date for a software platform that allows aspiring US college athletes to get recruited. It was a complex system involving many different elements, user types and features. With our primary in-house developer, we were running very late on our development schedule. We had a few months left to finish off the system before our customers began to use it. We brought AllianceTek on and they helped us get over the line with their amazing, responsive and high quality work. Without their tremendous work, we would not have been able to get over the line and give our customers a product that would be helpful to them. AllianceTek were honestly a game changer, and I could not imagine being where we are today as a company without their heavy and continued involvement.; The project has moved extremely smooth. The communication, the Dev team, I mean all of you guys over at Alliance Tech have just blown away my expectations and I can't thank you guys enough for helping me bring this idea into a reality. This is going to, not just revolutionise the industry, but revolutionise sales training in general. it's going to be able to present different scenarios, to the training platform getting feedback and uploading their videos to train to where we can train hundreds of people at the same time. I mean guys, this software that you guys have helped bring to life is truly going to change the industry.; Sokolis Group has been working with AllianceTek for almost a decade. We partnered with them to design and build a proprietary application that is critical to our business for analyzing and reporting our clients' fuel transaction data. Over the years, we have continued to work with AllianceTek to develop new features which helped make our business more efficient and our reporting to clients more insightful. In addition, AllianceTek provides the hosting and maintenance for this cloud-based application and we trust them to handle this important responsibility. They are a valued partner to our business and I would not hesitate to recommend them.; I work for a boutique leadership and communication consulting firm. As part of our service offerings, we provide clients a private and secure performance / developmental review site where employees are able to provide one another feedback on a regular cadence. We initially used an internal site, but as the scale of our projects and clients began to increase, we knew we needed to increase the sophistication of our site. That's where AllianceTek came in. Working together hand-in-hand, we developed a site tailored to the needs of our clients. Since development of the site, we've had clients ask for increased personalization and customization, and AllianceTek has been able to help us develop these in an expedient and efficient manner. Another bonus is that even after several years of working together, we've had the same points of contact throughout. This has been an invaluable part of us working together so well. After the past few years of working together, I couldn't recommend AllianceTek highly enough.; ; AllianceTek has delivered outstanding products and services which has helped Strategas achieve outstanding recognition from our financial services clients. Beyond those technical achievements, what sets this team apart from the crowd is the rapid responsiveness to my requests, be it a production problem, coding change, or business challenge; that kind of responsiveness is an exceptional work ethic not frequently seen in our industry and highly valued by my firm. I can always count upon this team to respond in kind with their best efforts.; ; "

LambdaTest,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2017,"Being a developer, responsive testing comes as a part of the package, every time I develop a webpage. I have been relying over LambdaTest for responsive testing. They have a feature which allows me to capture full page screenshots of my webpages in scores of different devices. I could even capture web pages that are locally hosted. And now, they have come up with a browser that lets me not only capture screenshots but interact with my websites in 25+ different devices, in a side by side view. That allows me to test my website responsiveness on a bunch of devices in a live-interactive manner. I must admit I am highly impressed by the LT browser and I am a tough guy to impress.; We use LambdaTest across our development & testing team. Our developers always perform cross browser tests on their local pages across different browsers and their versions before sending them to the testers. The integrations with 3rd party tools make it more useful. It provides a full development environment that looks very close to the real thing.Before we started using LambdaTest, we're limited to the browsers and their versions that are available on our desktops and laptops. But now with LambdaTest, we are using Selenium grid of 2000+ browsers and their versions available on the platform.If you want a solution to replace testing infrastructure that is hard to main and look after, LambdaTest is the best solution according to us.; Have been using Lambdatest for around 1 year now, and could say that it’s a useful testing tool for our team. Offering great combinations of browsers and operating systems for you to test on and most importantly there are many types of additional logs that come with each test which helps in debugging.. Glad to see the integration with Travis CI due to which we could optimally use this tool with our CI CD pipelines directly. We were able to effectively run TestNG and Selenium tests using their documentation and as an added advantage their support team is quick and helpful.; The industry we function (e-commerce) has a broad category of audience. We need to make sure our website is accessible to everyone irrespective of the browser / operating system they use. Ofcourse, responsive web design check is a major bullet point over our testing checklist as well. As a B2C, it's crucial for us to stay ahead of the customers and we wanted a solution which could help us ensure our changes would work seamlessly when shipped to the Production. LambdaTest made a great fit here when considered the latest browsers on the product, ability to test local pages along with a complimentary access to LT browser which is an absolute delight for our developers and testers. It helps us save a considerable effort on responsive testing plus the native developer tools allow us to dig deep into any UI mismatch! Also As mentioned we could achieve wider test coverage in time by running multiple combinations of browsers in parallel with LambdaTest automation suite. Our director to purchase the subscription was due to their affordable pricing for the parallel tests and the communication from the support team!; Running tests serially can be a good option when your product is at an early stage. But as we scaled the product, we needed a tool to reduce test time execution and pace up our test cycles. LambdaTest simplified the Selenium testing experience for us with their cloud based platform which allowed us to execute our test cases in parallel on hundreds of browsers. We could easily automate the test cases, get the sessions recorded and share the test reports across the team for assessment using Asana integration. We even leverage the integration with CircleCI to run automated tests on LambdaTest through our pipeline. The CircleCI Orb is handy for testing our privately hosted application.It’s good to see now that using LambdaTest we could run multiple tests on multiple VM’s, saving us hours of testing time and maintenance cost of local infrastructure. Personally, one thing that LambdaTest does very well is continuing to provide tutorials for testing, so that we stay up to speed and are even able to learn new things.I definitely saw myself applying a lot of the new concepts that I learned from their blogs.; As technology advances, enterprises are switching from manual testing to Selenium Test Automation. But one area most enterprises are still struggling is with the scalability of running several tests in parallel. LambdaTest has been a boon for us when it comes to Selenium automation. With a Selenium Grid based on the cloud, we don't need to stress about setting up and maintaining infrastructure anymore. We can run hundreds of tests in parallel on 2000+ browsers and OS versions running on real machines. LambdaTest really helped us in reducing our web testing cost and at the same time scale it as and when required.To leverage on marketing campaigns, we needed to ensure all our deliverables render seamlessly on different mobile and desktop browsers our users use to view them from across the world. The geolocation testing functionality helped us set the location and test our website over various locations. At LambdaTest, we can now run geolocation testing to test our website across 40+ countries. The pricing plan is pretty simple and easy to grasp, with no hidden costs at all.; We needed a testing tool that was scalable enough to cover all the browsers and OS as per our clients requirement and at the same time integrate well into our workflow. Lambdatest provided us with the necessary features to meet our browser compatibility testing requirements. Without any hassle of configuring, installing or maintaining the virtual machines, we are able to launch local browser tests instantly. The best part is, Lambdatest also helps us run our Selenium based automated tests on its cloud infra - that too without burning a hole in our pocket. They offer extensive mobile and desktop browsers, thereby increasing our test coverage to maximum.; We serve a variety of clients across industries, thus we need to make sure our website is accessible from every desktop, mobile browser combination they use. Responsive web design is an integral part of our testing process. As a B2B, you want to make sure that your services are always a step ahead of your customers. And to achieve that, it's important to have a tool that keeps your code and web designing process in sync with the Production.LambdaTest's variety of browsers and local testing capabilities made it a perfect fit for our requirements. Additionally we got free access to LT Browser which is absolutely loved by our developers. We are now in a better position while tackling misbehaving websites with the help of it’s inbuilt dev tools. The best part is that LambdaTest offers an automated parallel testing that helped us achieve faster and wider test coverage over multiple browsers. Its affordable price and fast technical support made the purchase decision very easy for the team. And yes I absolutely love their support staff. They are truly available for 24*7.; While we develop our web applications, our top concern was to verify the unintentional changes to the application's visuals. We need to make sure that changing one component doesn't break the styling of another component. LambdaTest's Smart testing helped us to identify visual regression bugs for every new build. We could capture our website screenshots belonging to different environments i.e stage and production & upload them on the LambdaTest Visual Testing platform. We were able to discover visual deviations with pixel to pixel comparison by capturing screenshots, comparing them against the baseline image, and highlighting visual changes. The slider mode is very helpful to compare the visual discrepancies between the two images by toggling them. Overall, Smart testing helped us perform reliable visual testing at scale and eliminated the risk of delivering visual bugs."
Serverspace,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2019,"First of all I would like to thank Serverspace for this great platform! Out of other VPS services, this is my favorite, it offers me the flexibility to enhance my skills as a Full-Stack Developer as well as a server administrator. Well out of frustrations from other VPS services, since they have a lot of hassle to work on, this platform enabled me to easily pick my choice, add new memory capability just by a few clicks. I observed the great UI/UX of this platform, and I am planning to use this forever until this platform is still working.; I tried many cloud server providers like AWS, Azure, Google cloud and more but they didn't satisfy my needs but when I tried Serverspace I was shocked because of their server prices, for a startup that will be the best option, I saw that the price is low but the service is best as expensive, I am fully satisfied with this. I recommend Serverspace for startups once a time you see, a cybercriminal attacked my server in serverspace but... the company has reported me on time, so I saved my server from further attacks, Serverspace saved a lot of time and money.; What I like about this company is the many options offered to us customers since I'm a Windows/Linux User and most of my needs rely on multi-OS systems. That's why I run 4 servers with ServerSpace. Their Windows Machines are as good as you can imagine, they offer all the alternatives I need, and I also run servers with CentOS. With Serverspace, I can cover all my needs for my business, and the best part is I also have different options on the payment side. They only charge me for the current use and not a whole monthly amount in advance, and I can cancel any server I ordered at any second. Also, their support tickets get answered right away. It's pretty good. What I think they could do better is improve their automatic system detecting payments with Ever. Every time I pay with Ever, I have to send a support ticket with transaction ID and all info about the payment to add funds. I get a reply the same day, but I'd rather not have to notify it. I'm very happy with this service, and I'll; I tried six to seven cloud services before I settled with Serverspace. I am glad that I found it. All I need was a reliable, scalable, economical, and user-friendly server for my data crunching and web application. First, their pricing is way attractive. The bigger sites may start with some low teaser rates or even free credits, but their prices go up exponentially with more CPU and memory. Serverspace's pricing remains very reasonable. Granted they don't offer super big servers, I don't need them either. The other thing I like is that they charge significantly less when you turn off the server while other sites charge you the same. I like their simple offers; simple servers that let me build my own environments. The plethora of bells and whistles elsewhere turn me off. Their servers are generally reliable except they failed to turn on a couple of times. But they fixed it promptly and were responsive through the process. Their clean and intuitive web UI is helpful.; I work most of the time but I also trade forex to make some extra money. Since I am not always at home, I had to get an expert advisor for my trades and that was when I started looking for a reliable VPS service. I have been using Serverspace VPS for less than a year now and I can say it has been a peaceful experience in the sense that I never had to worry about shutting down of the server. It's very pocket-friendly and I like that I can pay daily as I use it. What I enjoy most is the option to shutdown a server without deleting or destroying it completely, that way I can restart the server when I need it and continue using it. Like I said, you only get charged for what you use. For a little fee, you also have the option to increase the size or speed of a VPS server if your work becomes bigger without having to get a new server. I can only hope to get more than 50 Mbps speed for the fixed plan as it takes more time to work when everything is so slow.; I have been using Serverspace for about 6 months now. System performance is good. I have never used a VPS before, so I need some help getting up and running. Support always answers back thru a support ticket, although you may have to wait up to 6 hours sometimes, the support is good. Their pricing has been great, and I plan to stay with the service.; Before I decided to use their servers to host our services, I checked out and tried many alternatives. Some time ago I found Serverspace at some offers comparer and I decided to give it a try and I'm really satisfied. There are no problems with servers which I met using servers from others. So at the moment, I think I will use Serverspace servers for my other projects and initiatives.; I like Serverspace! The relation between the purchase price and the performance is perfect. I like dealing with you because of the cheap prices and high performance. Also, the support team is fast, I always get my tickets resolved as fast as possible. The deployment of services is also fast. In general, I do have a good experience and would like to build a long-term relationship.; The uptime and the speed of the service are fantastic. The quality of support is second to none. Every time I need help, I get a very personalized answer and they always go the extra mile to solve my problem. I have tried many competitors in the past but none of them come close to the quality of service I am getting in Serverspace."

After interviewing multiple (8) companies, I selected Alliancetek because they were experienced, offered end to end solutions beyond a standard mobile app firm, and their price point was below competing firms.Alliancetek delivered on all promises with great professionalism. We had to pivot several times in the course of the project and each hurdle was handled without a hitch. My “team” consisted of 3 Alliancetek employees (1 project manager, 1 iOS developer, 1 Android developer) who I spoke with weekly through Microsoft Team meetings.

From start to finish my interaction with the team at IndiaNIC was professional, stress-free and I had complete trust in their ability to deliver. Their difference is :1. They don't use templates as standard, so could custom built to match my vision and created a website set-up that was completely bespoke to my needs.2. They took the time to listen to what I wanted but also brought their own ideas, experience, and creativity so that the end design was more rounded.3. They understood that I needed to see things in a visual context and have some flexibility to 'play' around with a few ideas. All of this was done face to face at their offices making the process highly personal.4.

LambdaTest,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2017,"Being a developer, responsive testing comes as a part of the package, every time I develop a webpage. I have been relying over LambdaTest for responsive testing. They have a feature which allows me to capture full page screenshots of my webpages in scores of different devices. I could even capture web pages that are locally hosted. And now, they have come up with a browser that lets me not only capture screenshots but interact with my websites in 25+ different devices, in a side by side view. That allows me to test my website responsiveness on a bunch of devices in a live-interactive manner. I must admit I am highly impressed by the LT browser and I am a tough guy to impress.; We use LambdaTest across our development & testing team. Our developers always perform cross browser tests on their local pages across different browsers and their versions before sending them to the testers. The integrations with 3rd party tools make it more useful. It provides a full development environment that looks very close to the real thing.Before we started using LambdaTest, we're limited to the browsers and their versions that are available on our desktops and laptops. But now with LambdaTest, we are using Selenium grid of 2000+ browsers and their versions available on the platform.If you want a solution to replace testing infrastructure that is hard to main and look after, LambdaTest is the best solution according to us.; Have been using Lambdatest for around 1 year now, and could say that it’s a useful testing tool for our team. Offering great combinations of browsers and operating systems for you to test on and most importantly there are many types of additional logs that come with each test which helps in debugging.. Glad to see the integration with Travis CI due to which we could optimally use this tool with our CI CD pipelines directly. We were able to effectively run TestNG and Selenium tests using their documentation and as an added advantage their support team is quick and helpful.; The industry we function (e-commerce) has a broad category of audience. We need to make sure our website is accessible to everyone irrespective of the browser / operating system they use. Ofcourse, responsive web design check is a major bullet point over our testing checklist as well. As a B2C, it's crucial for us to stay ahead of the customers and we wanted a solution which could help us ensure our changes would work seamlessly when shipped to the Production. LambdaTest made a great fit here when considered the latest browsers on the product, ability to test local pages along with a complimentary access to LT browser which is an absolute delight for our developers and testers. It helps us save a considerable effort on responsive testing plus the native developer tools allow us to dig deep into any UI mismatch! Also As mentioned we could achieve wider test coverage in time by running multiple combinations of browsers in parallel with LambdaTest automation suite. Our director to purchase the subscription was due to their affordable pricing for the parallel tests and the communication from the support team!; Running tests serially can be a good option when your product is at an early stage. But as we scaled the product, we needed a tool to reduce test time execution and pace up our test cycles. LambdaTest simplified the Selenium testing experience for us with their cloud based platform which allowed us to execute our test cases in parallel on hundreds of browsers. We could easily automate the test cases, get the sessions recorded and share the test reports across the team for assessment using Asana integration. We even leverage the integration with CircleCI to run automated tests on LambdaTest through our pipeline. The CircleCI Orb is handy for testing our privately hosted application.It’s good to see now that using LambdaTest we could run multiple tests on multiple VM’s, saving us hours of testing time and maintenance cost of local infrastructure. Personally, one thing that LambdaTest does very well is continuing to provide tutorials for testing, so that we stay up to speed and are even able to learn new things.I definitely saw myself applying a lot of the new concepts that I learned from their blogs.; As technology advances, enterprises are switching from manual testing to Selenium Test Automation. But one area most enterprises are still struggling is with the scalability of running several tests in parallel. LambdaTest has been a boon for us when it comes to Selenium automation. With a Selenium Grid based on the cloud, we don't need to stress about setting up and maintaining infrastructure anymore. We can run hundreds of tests in parallel on 2000+ browsers and OS versions running on real machines. LambdaTest really helped us in reducing our web testing cost and at the same time scale it as and when required.To leverage on marketing campaigns, we needed to ensure all our deliverables render seamlessly on different mobile and desktop browsers our users use to view them from across the world. The geolocation testing functionality helped us set the location and test our website over various locations. At LambdaTest, we can now run geolocation testing to test our website across 40+ countries. The pricing plan is pretty simple and easy to grasp, with no hidden costs at all.; We needed a testing tool that was scalable enough to cover all the browsers and OS as per our clients requirement and at the same time integrate well into our workflow. Lambdatest provided us with the necessary features to meet our browser compatibility testing requirements. Without any hassle of configuring, installing or maintaining the virtual machines, we are able to launch local browser tests instantly. The best part is, Lambdatest also helps us run our Selenium based automated tests on its cloud infra - that too without burning a hole in our pocket. They offer extensive mobile and desktop browsers, thereby increasing our test coverage to maximum.; We serve a variety of clients across industries, thus we need to make sure our website is accessible from every desktop, mobile browser combination they use. Responsive web design is an integral part of our testing process. As a B2B, you want to make sure that your services are always a step ahead of your customers. And to achieve that, it's important to have a tool that keeps your code and web designing process in sync with the Production.LambdaTest's variety of browsers and local testing capabilities made it a perfect fit for our requirements. Additionally we got free access to LT Browser which is absolutely loved by our developers. We are now in a better position while tackling misbehaving websites with the help of it’s inbuilt dev tools. The best part is that LambdaTest offers an automated parallel testing that helped us achieve faster and wider test coverage over multiple browsers. Its affordable price and fast technical support made the purchase decision very easy for the team. And yes I absolutely love their support staff. They are truly available for 24*7.; While we develop our web applications, our top concern was to verify the unintentional changes to the application's visuals. We need to make sure that changing one component doesn't break the styling of another component. LambdaTest's Smart testing helped us to identify visual regression bugs for every new build. We could capture our website screenshots belonging to different environments i.e stage and production & upload them on the LambdaTest Visual Testing platform. We were able to discover visual deviations with pixel to pixel comparison by capturing screenshots, comparing them against the baseline image, and highlighting visual changes. The slider mode is very helpful to compare the visual discrepancies between the two images by toggling them. Overall, Smart testing helped us perform reliable visual testing at scale and eliminated the risk of delivering visual bugs."
Serverspace,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2019,"First of all I would like to thank Serverspace for this great platform! Out of other VPS services, this is my favorite, it offers me the flexibility to enhance my skills as a Full-Stack Developer as well as a server administrator. Well out of frustrations from other VPS services, since they have a lot of hassle to work on, this platform enabled me to easily pick my choice, add new memory capability just by a few clicks. I observed the great UI/UX of this platform, and I am planning to use this forever until this platform is still working.; I tried many cloud server providers like AWS, Azure, Google cloud and more but they didn't satisfy my needs but when I tried Serverspace I was shocked because of their server prices, for a startup that will be the best option, I saw that the price is low but the service is best as expensive, I am fully satisfied with this. I recommend Serverspace for startups once a time you see, a cybercriminal attacked my server in serverspace but... the company has reported me on time, so I saved my server from further attacks, Serverspace saved a lot of time and money.; What I like about this company is the many options offered to us customers since I'm a Windows/Linux User and most of my needs rely on multi-OS systems. That's why I run 4 servers with ServerSpace. Their Windows Machines are as good as you can imagine, they offer all the alternatives I need, and I also run servers with CentOS. With Serverspace, I can cover all my needs for my business, and the best part is I also have different options on the payment side. They only charge me for the current use and not a whole monthly amount in advance, and I can cancel any server I ordered at any second. Also, their support tickets get answered right away. It's pretty good. What I think they could do better is improve their automatic system detecting payments with Ever. Every time I pay with Ever, I have to send a support ticket with transaction ID and all info about the payment to add funds. I get a reply the same day, but I'd rather not have to notify it. I'm very happy with this service, and I'll; I tried six to seven cloud services before I settled with Serverspace. I am glad that I found it. All I need was a reliable, scalable, economical, and user-friendly server for my data crunching and web application. First, their pricing is way attractive. The bigger sites may start with some low teaser rates or even free credits, but their prices go up exponentially with more CPU and memory. Serverspace's pricing remains very reasonable. Granted they don't offer super big servers, I don't need them either. The other thing I like is that they charge significantly less when you turn off the server while other sites charge you the same. I like their simple offers; simple servers that let me build my own environments. The plethora of bells and whistles elsewhere turn me off. Their servers are generally reliable except they failed to turn on a couple of times. But they fixed it promptly and were responsive through the process. Their clean and intuitive web UI is helpful.; I work most of the time but I also trade forex to make some extra money. Since I am not always at home, I had to get an expert advisor for my trades and that was when I started looking for a reliable VPS service. I have been using Serverspace VPS for less than a year now and I can say it has been a peaceful experience in the sense that I never had to worry about shutting down of the server. It's very pocket-friendly and I like that I can pay daily as I use it. What I enjoy most is the option to shutdown a server without deleting or destroying it completely, that way I can restart the server when I need it and continue using it. Like I said, you only get charged for what you use. For a little fee, you also have the option to increase the size or speed of a VPS server if your work becomes bigger without having to get a new server. I can only hope to get more than 50 Mbps speed for the fixed plan as it takes more time to work when everything is so slow.; I have been using Serverspace for about 6 months now. System performance is good. I have never used a VPS before, so I need some help getting up and running. Support always answers back thru a support ticket, although you may have to wait up to 6 hours sometimes, the support is good. Their pricing has been great, and I plan to stay with the service.; Before I decided to use their servers to host our services, I checked out and tried many alternatives. Some time ago I found Serverspace at some offers comparer and I decided to give it a try and I'm really satisfied. There are no problems with servers which I met using servers from others. So at the moment, I think I will use Serverspace servers for my other projects and initiatives.; I like Serverspace! The relation between the purchase price and the performance is perfect. I like dealing with you because of the cheap prices and high performance. Also, the support team is fast, I always get my tickets resolved as fast as possible. The deployment of services is also fast. In general, I do have a good experience and would like to build a long-term relationship.; The uptime and the speed of the service are fantastic. The quality of support is second to none. Every time I need help, I get a very personalized answer and they always go the extra mile to solve my problem. I have tried many competitors in the past but none of them come close to the quality of service I am getting in Serverspace."

After interviewing multiple (8) companies, I selected Alliancetek because they were experienced, offered end to end solutions beyond a standard mobile app firm, and their price point was below competing firms.Alliancetek delivered on all promises with great professionalism. We had to pivot several times in the course of the project and each hurdle was handled without a hitch.

Over the years, we have continued to work with AllianceTek to develop new features which helped make our business more efficient and our reporting to clients more insightful. In addition, AllianceTek provides the hosting and maintenance for this cloud-based application and we trust them to handle this important responsibility. They are a valued partner to our business and I would not hesitate to recommend them.; I work for a boutique leadership and communication consulting firm. As part of our service offerings, we provide clients a private and secure performance / developmental review site where employees are able to provide one another feedback on a regular cadence. We initially used an internal site, but as the scale of our projects and clients began to increase, we knew we needed to increase the sophistication of our site. That's where AllianceTek came in. Working together hand-in-hand, we developed a site tailored to the needs of our clients. Since development of the site, we've had clients ask for increased personalization and customization, and AllianceTek has been able to help us develop these in an expedient and efficient manner. Another bonus is that even after several years of working together, we've had the same points of contact throughout. This has been an invaluable part of us working together so well. After the past few years of working together, I couldn't recommend AllianceTek highly enough.; ; AllianceTek has delivered outstanding products and services which has helped Strategas achieve outstanding recognition from our financial services clients. Beyond those technical achievements, what sets this team apart from the crowd is the rapid responsiveness to my requests, be it a production problem, coding change, or business challenge; that kind of responsiveness is an exceptional work ethic not frequently seen in our industry and highly valued by my firm. I can always count upon this team to respond in kind with their best efforts.; ; "

< $25/hr ",2017,"Being a developer, responsive testing comes as a part of the package, every time I develop a webpage. I have been relying over LambdaTest for responsive testing. They have a feature which allows me to capture full page screenshots of my webpages in scores of different devices. I could even capture web pages that are locally hosted. And now, they have come up with a browser that lets me not only capture screenshots but interact with my websites in 25+ different devices, in a side by side view. That allows me to test my website responsiveness on a bunch of devices in a live-interactive manner. I must admit I am highly impressed by the LT browser and I am a tough guy to impress.; We use LambdaTest across our development & testing team. Our developers always perform cross browser tests on their local pages across different browsers and their versions before sending them to the testers. The integrations with 3rd party tools make it more useful. It provides a full development environment that looks very close to the real thing.Before we started using LambdaTest, we're limited to the browsers and their versions that are available on our desktops and laptops. But now with LambdaTest, we are using Selenium grid of 2000+ browsers and their versions available on the platform.If you want a solution to replace testing infrastructure that is hard to main and look after, LambdaTest is the best solution according to us.; Have been using Lambdatest for around 1 year now, and could say that it’s a useful testing tool for our team. Offering great combinations of browsers and operating systems for you to test on and most importantly there are many types of additional logs that come with each test which helps in debugging.. Glad to see the integration with Travis CI due to which we could optimally use this tool with our CI CD pipelines directly. We were able to effectively run TestNG and Selenium tests using their documentation and as an added advantage their support team is quick and helpful.; The industry we function (e-commerce) has a broad category of audience. We need to make sure our website is accessible to everyone irrespective of the browser / operating system they use. Ofcourse, responsive web design check is a major bullet point over our testing checklist as well. As a B2C, it's crucial for us to stay ahead of the customers and we wanted a solution which could help us ensure our changes would work seamlessly when shipped to the Production. LambdaTest made a great fit here when considered the latest browsers on the product, ability to test local pages along with a complimentary access to LT browser which is an absolute delight for our developers and testers. It helps us save a considerable effort on responsive testing plus the native developer tools allow us to dig deep into any UI mismatch! Also As mentioned we could achieve wider test coverage in time by running multiple combinations of browsers in parallel with LambdaTest automation suite. Our director to purchase the subscription was due to their affordable pricing for the parallel tests and the communication from the support team!; Running tests serially can be a good option when your product is at an early stage. But as we scaled the product, we needed a tool to reduce test time execution and pace up our test cycles. LambdaTest simplified the Selenium testing experience for us with their cloud based platform which allowed us to execute our test cases in parallel on hundreds of browsers. We could easily automate the test cases, get the sessions recorded and share the test reports across the team for assessment using Asana integration. We even leverage the integration with CircleCI to run automated tests on LambdaTest through our pipeline. The CircleCI Orb is handy for testing our privately hosted application.It’s good to see now that using LambdaTest we could run multiple tests on multiple VM’s, saving us hours of testing time and maintenance cost of local infrastructure. Personally, one thing that LambdaTest does very well is continuing to provide tutorials for testing, so that we stay up to speed and are even able to learn new things.I definitely saw myself applying a lot of the new concepts that I learned from their blogs.; As technology advances, enterprises are switching from manual testing to Selenium Test Automation. But one area most enterprises are still struggling is with the scalability of running several tests in parallel. LambdaTest has been a boon for us when it comes to Selenium automation. With a Selenium Grid based on the cloud, we don't need to stress about setting up and maintaining infrastructure anymore. We can run hundreds of tests in parallel on 2000+ browsers and OS versions running on real machines. LambdaTest really helped us in reducing our web testing cost and at the same time scale it as and when required.To leverage on marketing campaigns, we needed to ensure all our deliverables render seamlessly on different mobile and desktop browsers our users use to view them from across the world. The geolocation testing functionality helped us set the location and test our website over various locations. At LambdaTest, we can now run geolocation testing to test our website across 40+ countries. The pricing plan is pretty simple and easy to grasp, with no hidden costs at all.; We needed a testing tool that was scalable enough to cover all the browsers and OS as per our clients requirement and at the same time integrate well into our workflow. Lambdatest provided us with the necessary features to meet our browser compatibility testing requirements. Without any hassle of configuring, installing or maintaining the virtual machines, we are able to launch local browser tests instantly. The best part is, Lambdatest also helps us run our Selenium based automated tests on its cloud infra - that too without burning a hole in our pocket. They offer extensive mobile and desktop browsers, thereby increasing our test coverage to maximum.; We serve a variety of clients across industries, thus we need to make sure our website is accessible from every desktop, mobile browser combination they use. Responsive web design is an integral part of our testing process. As a B2B, you want to make sure that your services are always a step ahead of your customers. And to achieve that, it's important to have a tool that keeps your code and web designing process in sync with the Production.LambdaTest's variety of browsers and local testing capabilities made it a perfect fit for our requirements. Additionally we got free access to LT Browser which is absolutely loved by our developers. We are now in a better position while tackling misbehaving websites with the help of it’s inbuilt dev tools. The best part is that LambdaTest offers an automated parallel testing that helped us achieve faster and wider test coverage over multiple browsers. Its affordable price and fast technical support made the purchase decision very easy for the team. And yes I absolutely love their support staff. They are truly available for 24*7.; While we develop our web applications, our top concern was to verify the unintentional changes to the application's visuals. We need to make sure that changing one component doesn't break the styling of another component. LambdaTest's Smart testing helped us to identify visual regression bugs for every new build. We could capture our website screenshots belonging to different environments i.e stage and production & upload them on the LambdaTest Visual Testing platform. We were able to discover visual deviations with pixel to pixel comparison by capturing screenshots, comparing them against the baseline image, and highlighting visual changes. The slider mode is very helpful to compare the visual discrepancies between the two images by toggling them. Overall, Smart testing helped us perform reliable visual testing at scale and eliminated the risk of delivering visual bugs."
Serverspace,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2019,"First of all I would like to thank Serverspace for this great platform! Out of other VPS services, this is my favorite, it offers me the flexibility to enhance my skills as a Full-Stack Developer as well as a server administrator. Well out of frustrations from other VPS services, since they have a lot of hassle to work on, this platform enabled me to easily pick my choice, add new memory capability just by a few clicks. I observed the great UI/UX of this platform, and I am planning to use this forever until this platform is still working.; I tried many cloud server providers like AWS, Azure, Google cloud and more but they didn't satisfy my needs but when I tried Serverspace I was shocked because of their server prices, for a startup that will be the best option, I saw that the price is low but the service is best as expensive, I am fully satisfied with this. I recommend Serverspace for startups once a time you see, a cybercriminal attacked my server in serverspace but... the company has reported me on time, so I saved my server from further attacks, Serverspace saved a lot of time and money.; What I like about this company is the many options offered to us customers since I'm a Windows/Linux User and most of my needs rely on multi-OS systems. That's why I run 4 servers with ServerSpace. Their Windows Machines are as good as you can imagine, they offer all the alternatives I need, and I also run servers with CentOS. With Serverspace, I can cover all my needs for my business, and the best part is I also have different options on the payment side. They only charge me for the current use and not a whole monthly amount in advance, and I can cancel any server I ordered at any second. Also, their support tickets get answered right away. It's pretty good. What I think they could do better is improve their automatic system detecting payments with Ever. Every time I pay with Ever, I have to send a support ticket with transaction ID and all info about the payment to add funds. I get a reply the same day, but I'd rather not have to notify it. I'm very happy with this service, and I'll; I tried six to seven cloud services before I settled with Serverspace. I am glad that I found it. All I need was a reliable, scalable, economical, and user-friendly server for my data crunching and web application. First, their pricing is way attractive. The bigger sites may start with some low teaser rates or even free credits, but their prices go up exponentially with more CPU and memory. Serverspace's pricing remains very reasonable. Granted they don't offer super big servers, I don't need them either. The other thing I like is that they charge significantly less when you turn off the server while other sites charge you the same. I like their simple offers; simple servers that let me build my own environments. The plethora of bells and whistles elsewhere turn me off. Their servers are generally reliable except they failed to turn on a couple of times. But they fixed it promptly and were responsive through the process. Their clean and intuitive web UI is helpful.; I work most of the time but I also trade forex to make some extra money. Since I am not always at home, I had to get an expert advisor for my trades and that was when I started looking for a reliable VPS service. I have been using Serverspace VPS for less than a year now and I can say it has been a peaceful experience in the sense that I never had to worry about shutting down of the server. It's very pocket-friendly and I like that I can pay daily as I use it. What I enjoy most is the option to shutdown a server without deleting or destroying it completely, that way I can restart the server when I need it and continue using it. Like I said, you only get charged for what you use. For a little fee, you also have the option to increase the size or speed of a VPS server if your work becomes bigger without having to get a new server. I can only hope to get more than 50 Mbps speed for the fixed plan as it takes more time to work when everything is so slow.; I have been using Serverspace for about 6 months now. System performance is good. I have never used a VPS before, so I need some help getting up and running. Support always answers back thru a support ticket, although you may have to wait up to 6 hours sometimes, the support is good. Their pricing has been great, and I plan to stay with the service.; Before I decided to use their servers to host our services, I checked out and tried many alternatives. Some time ago I found Serverspace at some offers comparer and I decided to give it a try and I'm really satisfied. There are no problems with servers which I met using servers from others. So at the moment, I think I will use Serverspace servers for my other projects and initiatives.; I like Serverspace! The relation between the purchase price and the performance is perfect. I like dealing with you because of the cheap prices and high performance. Also, the support team is fast, I always get my tickets resolved as fast as possible. The deployment of services is also fast. In general, I do have a good experience and would like to build a long-term relationship.; The uptime and the speed of the service are fantastic. The quality of support is second to none. Every time I need help, I get a very personalized answer and they always go the extra mile to solve my problem. I have tried many competitors in the past but none of them come close to the quality of service I am getting in Serverspace."

They have end-to-end capability and in a couple of cases they are the technology arm of my organization. They are very transparent in all their communications and interactions. So I have never been blindsighted by a key resource resigning for example. Would certainly recommend them to others; I highly recommend Amit and his team to anyone looking for a knowledgeable developer who is easy to work with and can quickly build a sophisticated scalable product. Throughout the development process, they became part of my team and were extremely proactive in tweaking and improving the product based on customer feedback. Furthermore, they always went out of their way to guide me on the best development practices to test, build and scale a product. It was a pleasure working with them and highly recommend them to everyone.; We decided to work with MetaDesign Solutions for our project as we found their offer appealing as well as affordable, especially considering our requirements. They assigned us a dedicated team and their team lead was extremely thorough in understanding our vision and implementing it correctly. We were updated about the project status whenever we wanted or when a major milestone was achieved.; We have been working with MetaDesign since Dec 2010 and have steadily grown our engagement from 1 resource to currently 35+ and growing.The team here provides us with both development and testing services.

The final project was delivered and implemented without major complications. Currently the Codebay team provides us with support and system updates.; We hire them for the development of a web application. A member of their team, Luis Sanchez was in charge of the project, we had several meetings to define the content and structure of the first sites. Later, he presented us graphic proposals and based on this, they began to develop. During development there were adjustments; Comparing them with the company I had worked with before, their communications are way superior. I always know exactly what they're working on, specifically the stage of the process where they're at. In addition, they're always upfront whenever things might take longer than expected. However, for the most part, they've completed things in a timely manner or even ahead of schedule.; We started working with a cloud specialist, who reviewed our current systems and implemented a work plan to migrate to the cloud. The process did not take that long, but we had complications migrating the information as our old servers were constantly crashing due to the workload. Eventually we managed to migrate everything, and from there Codebay has provided us with maintenance services.; We start by planning the different stages of development with the support of an architect and the design area. We already had a system made in .NET, so the new platform was programmed in the same language. The development had different variables which took a year to complete, currently we continue working with them with support and system improvements.; We have worked together for a few months and it has been a positive experience, the team besides being very committed to development, they have shown good technical skills. The management team has been aware of any issue and has been very open to follow up on doubts.; Codebay has served as the supporting development team for a startup incubation university.

$25 - $49/hr ",2004,"We are a startup fintech company and needed to develop a mobile app in iOS and Android. The app is a social media platform for investing with back end analytics similar to Twitter. The development required integration with a high end data provider and a separate charting platform. After interviewing multiple (8) companies, I selected Alliancetek because they were experienced, offered end to end solutions beyond a standard mobile app firm, and their price point was below competing firms.Alliancetek delivered on all promises with great professionalism. We had to pivot several times in the course of the project and each hurdle was handled without a hitch. My “team” consisted of 3 Alliancetek employees (1 project manager, 1 iOS developer, 1 Android developer) who I spoke with weekly through Microsoft Team meetings. There were additional back end developers who worked on the project. I had an outstanding experience and give Alliancetek my highest recommendation.; My company was close to the launch date for a software platform that allows aspiring US college athletes to get recruited. It was a complex system involving many different elements, user types and features. With our primary in-house developer, we were running very late on our development schedule. We had a few months left to finish off the system before our customers began to use it. We brought AllianceTek on and they helped us get over the line with their amazing, responsive and high quality work. Without their tremendous work, we would not have been able to get over the line and give our customers a product that would be helpful to them. AllianceTek were honestly a game changer, and I could not imagine being where we are today as a company without their heavy and continued involvement.; The project has moved extremely smooth. The communication, the Dev team, I mean all of you guys over at Alliance Tech have just blown away my expectations and I can't thank you guys enough for helping me bring this idea into a reality. This is going to, not just revolutionise the industry, but revolutionise sales training in general. it's going to be able to present different scenarios, to the training platform getting feedback and uploading their videos to train to where we can train hundreds of people at the same time. I mean guys, this software that you guys have helped bring to life is truly going to change the industry.; Sokolis Group has been working with AllianceTek for almost a decade. We partnered with them to design and build a proprietary application that is critical to our business for analyzing and reporting our clients' fuel transaction data. Over the years, we have continued to work with AllianceTek to develop new features which helped make our business more efficient and our reporting to clients more insightful. In addition, AllianceTek provides the hosting and maintenance for this cloud-based application and we trust them to handle this important responsibility. They are a valued partner to our business and I would not hesitate to recommend them.; I work for a boutique leadership and communication consulting firm. As part of our service offerings, we provide clients a private and secure performance / developmental review site where employees are able to provide one another feedback on a regular cadence. We initially used an internal site, but as the scale of our projects and clients began to increase, we knew we needed to increase the sophistication of our site. That's where AllianceTek came in. Working together hand-in-hand, we developed a site tailored to the needs of our clients. Since development of the site, we've had clients ask for increased personalization and customization, and AllianceTek has been able to help us develop these in an expedient and efficient manner. Another bonus is that even after several years of working together, we've had the same points of contact throughout. This has been an invaluable part of us working together so well. After the past few years of working together, I couldn't recommend AllianceTek highly enough.; ; AllianceTek has delivered outstanding products and services which has helped Strategas achieve outstanding recognition from our financial services clients. Beyond those technical achievements, what sets this team apart from the crowd is the rapid responsiveness to my requests, be it a production problem, coding change, or business challenge; that kind of responsiveness is an exceptional work ethic not frequently seen in our industry and highly valued by my firm. I can always count upon this team to respond in kind with their best efforts.; ; "

< $25/hr ",2017,"Being a developer, responsive testing comes as a part of the package, every time I develop a webpage. I have been relying over LambdaTest for responsive testing. They have a feature which allows me to capture full page screenshots of my webpages in scores of different devices. I could even capture web pages that are locally hosted. And now, they have come up with a browser that lets me not only capture screenshots but interact with my websites in 25+ different devices, in a side by side view. That allows me to test my website responsiveness on a bunch of devices in a live-interactive manner. I must admit I am highly impressed by the LT browser and I am a tough guy to impress.; We use LambdaTest across our development & testing team. Our developers always perform cross browser tests on their local pages across different browsers and their versions before sending them to the testers. The integrations with 3rd party tools make it more useful. It provides a full development environment that looks very close to the real thing.Before we started using LambdaTest, we're limited to the browsers and their versions that are available on our desktops and laptops. But now with LambdaTest, we are using Selenium grid of 2000+ browsers and their versions available on the platform.If you want a solution to replace testing infrastructure that is hard to main and look after, LambdaTest is the best solution according to us.; Have been using Lambdatest for around 1 year now, and could say that it’s a useful testing tool for our team. Offering great combinations of browsers and operating systems for you to test on and most importantly there are many types of additional logs that come with each test which helps in debugging.. Glad to see the integration with Travis CI due to which we could optimally use this tool with our CI CD pipelines directly. We were able to effectively run TestNG and Selenium tests using their documentation and as an added advantage their support team is quick and helpful.; The industry we function (e-commerce) has a broad category of audience. We need to make sure our website is accessible to everyone irrespective of the browser / operating system they use. Ofcourse, responsive web design check is a major bullet point over our testing checklist as well. As a B2C, it's crucial for us to stay ahead of the customers and we wanted a solution which could help us ensure our changes would work seamlessly when shipped to the Production. LambdaTest made a great fit here when considered the latest browsers on the product, ability to test local pages along with a complimentary access to LT browser which is an absolute delight for our developers and testers. It helps us save a considerable effort on responsive testing plus the native developer tools allow us to dig deep into any UI mismatch! Also As mentioned we could achieve wider test coverage in time by running multiple combinations of browsers in parallel with LambdaTest automation suite. Our director to purchase the subscription was due to their affordable pricing for the parallel tests and the communication from the support team!; Running tests serially can be a good option when your product is at an early stage. But as we scaled the product, we needed a tool to reduce test time execution and pace up our test cycles. LambdaTest simplified the Selenium testing experience for us with their cloud based platform which allowed us to execute our test cases in parallel on hundreds of browsers. We could easily automate the test cases, get the sessions recorded and share the test reports across the team for assessment using Asana integration. We even leverage the integration with CircleCI to run automated tests on LambdaTest through our pipeline. The CircleCI Orb is handy for testing our privately hosted application.It’s good to see now that using LambdaTest we could run multiple tests on multiple VM’s, saving us hours of testing time and maintenance cost of local infrastructure. Personally, one thing that LambdaTest does very well is continuing to provide tutorials for testing, so that we stay up to speed and are even able to learn new things.I definitely saw myself applying a lot of the new concepts that I learned from their blogs.; As technology advances, enterprises are switching from manual testing to Selenium Test Automation. But one area most enterprises are still struggling is with the scalability of running several tests in parallel. LambdaTest has been a boon for us when it comes to Selenium automation. With a Selenium Grid based on the cloud, we don't need to stress about setting up and maintaining infrastructure anymore. We can run hundreds of tests in parallel on 2000+ browsers and OS versions running on real machines. LambdaTest really helped us in reducing our web testing cost and at the same time scale it as and when required.To leverage on marketing campaigns, we needed to ensure all our deliverables render seamlessly on different mobile and desktop browsers our users use to view them from across the world. The geolocation testing functionality helped us set the location and test our website over various locations. At LambdaTest, we can now run geolocation testing to test our website across 40+ countries. The pricing plan is pretty simple and easy to grasp, with no hidden costs at all.; We needed a testing tool that was scalable enough to cover all the browsers and OS as per our clients requirement and at the same time integrate well into our workflow. Lambdatest provided us with the necessary features to meet our browser compatibility testing requirements. Without any hassle of configuring, installing or maintaining the virtual machines, we are able to launch local browser tests instantly. The best part is, Lambdatest also helps us run our Selenium based automated tests on its cloud infra - that too without burning a hole in our pocket. They offer extensive mobile and desktop browsers, thereby increasing our test coverage to maximum.; We serve a variety of clients across industries, thus we need to make sure our website is accessible from every desktop, mobile browser combination they use. Responsive web design is an integral part of our testing process. As a B2B, you want to make sure that your services are always a step ahead of your customers. And to achieve that, it's important to have a tool that keeps your code and web designing process in sync with the Production.LambdaTest's variety of browsers and local testing capabilities made it a perfect fit for our requirements. Additionally we got free access to LT Browser which is absolutely loved by our developers. We are now in a better position while tackling misbehaving websites with the help of it’s inbuilt dev tools. The best part is that LambdaTest offers an automated parallel testing that helped us achieve faster and wider test coverage over multiple browsers. Its affordable price and fast technical support made the purchase decision very easy for the team. And yes I absolutely love their support staff. They are truly available for 24*7.; While we develop our web applications, our top concern was to verify the unintentional changes to the application's visuals. We need to make sure that changing one component doesn't break the styling of another component. LambdaTest's Smart testing helped us to identify visual regression bugs for every new build. We could capture our website screenshots belonging to different environments i.e stage and production & upload them on the LambdaTest Visual Testing platform. We were able to discover visual deviations with pixel to pixel comparison by capturing screenshots, comparing them against the baseline image, and highlighting visual changes. The slider mode is very helpful to compare the visual discrepancies between the two images by toggling them. Overall, Smart testing helped us perform reliable visual testing at scale and eliminated the risk of delivering visual bugs."
Serverspace,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2019,"First of all I would like to thank Serverspace for this great platform! Out of other VPS services, this is my favorite, it offers me the flexibility to enhance my skills as a Full-Stack Developer as well as a server administrator. Well out of frustrations from other VPS services, since they have a lot of hassle to work on, this platform enabled me to easily pick my choice, add new memory capability just by a few clicks. I observed the great UI/UX of this platform, and I am planning to use this forever until this platform is still working.; I tried many cloud server providers like AWS, Azure, Google cloud and more but they didn't satisfy my needs but when I tried Serverspace I was shocked because of their server prices, for a startup that will be the best option, I saw that the price is low but the service is best as expensive, I am fully satisfied with this. I recommend Serverspace for startups once a time you see, a cybercriminal attacked my server in serverspace but... the company has reported me on time, so I saved my server from further attacks, Serverspace saved a lot of time and money.; What I like about this company is the many options offered to us customers since I'm a Windows/Linux User and most of my needs rely on multi-OS systems. That's why I run 4 servers with ServerSpace. Their Windows Machines are as good as you can imagine, they offer all the alternatives I need, and I also run servers with CentOS. With Serverspace, I can cover all my needs for my business, and the best part is I also have different options on the payment side. They only charge me for the current use and not a whole monthly amount in advance, and I can cancel any server I ordered at any second. Also, their support tickets get answered right away. It's pretty good. What I think they could do better is improve their automatic system detecting payments with Ever. Every time I pay with Ever, I have to send a support ticket with transaction ID and all info about the payment to add funds. I get a reply the same day, but I'd rather not have to notify it. I'm very happy with this service, and I'll; I tried six to seven cloud services before I settled with Serverspace. I am glad that I found it. All I need was a reliable, scalable, economical, and user-friendly server for my data crunching and web application. First, their pricing is way attractive. The bigger sites may start with some low teaser rates or even free credits, but their prices go up exponentially with more CPU and memory. Serverspace's pricing remains very reasonable. Granted they don't offer super big servers, I don't need them either. The other thing I like is that they charge significantly less when you turn off the server while other sites charge you the same. I like their simple offers; simple servers that let me build my own environments. The plethora of bells and whistles elsewhere turn me off. Their servers are generally reliable except they failed to turn on a couple of times. But they fixed it promptly and were responsive through the process. Their clean and intuitive web UI is helpful.; I work most of the time but I also trade forex to make some extra money. Since I am not always at home, I had to get an expert advisor for my trades and that was when I started looking for a reliable VPS service. I have been using Serverspace VPS for less than a year now and I can say it has been a peaceful experience in the sense that I never had to worry about shutting down of the server. It's very pocket-friendly and I like that I can pay daily as I use it. What I enjoy most is the option to shutdown a server without deleting or destroying it completely, that way I can restart the server when I need it and continue using it. Like I said, you only get charged for what you use. For a little fee, you also have the option to increase the size or speed of a VPS server if your work becomes bigger without having to get a new server. I can only hope to get more than 50 Mbps speed for the fixed plan as it takes more time to work when everything is so slow.; I have been using Serverspace for about 6 months now. System performance is good. I have never used a VPS before, so I need some help getting up and running. Support always answers back thru a support ticket, although you may have to wait up to 6 hours sometimes, the support is good. Their pricing has been great, and I plan to stay with the service.; Before I decided to use their servers to host our services, I checked out and tried many alternatives. Some time ago I found Serverspace at some offers comparer and I decided to give it a try and I'm really satisfied. There are no problems with servers which I met using servers from others.

The app is a social media platform for investing with back end analytics similar to Twitter. The development required integration with a high end data provider and a separate charting platform. After interviewing multiple (8) companies, I selected Alliancetek because they were experienced, offered end to end solutions beyond a standard mobile app firm, and their price point was below competing firms.Alliancetek delivered on all promises with great professionalism. We had to pivot several times in the course of the project and each hurdle was handled without a hitch. My “team” consisted of 3 Alliancetek employees (1 project manager, 1 iOS developer, 1 Android developer) who I spoke with weekly through Microsoft Team meetings. There were additional back end developers who worked on the project. I had an outstanding experience and give Alliancetek my highest recommendation.; My company was close to the launch date for a software platform that allows aspiring US college athletes to get recruited. It was a complex system involving many different elements, user types and features. With our primary in-house developer, we were running very late on our development schedule. We had a few months left to finish off the system before our customers began to use it. We brought AllianceTek on and they helped us get over the line with their amazing, responsive and high quality work. Without their tremendous work, we would not have been able to get over the line and give our customers a product that would be helpful to them. AllianceTek were honestly a game changer, and I could not imagine being where we are today as a company without their heavy and continued involvement.; The project has moved extremely smooth. The communication, the Dev team, I mean all of you guys over at Alliance Tech have just blown away my expectations and I can't thank you guys enough for helping me bring this idea into a reality. This is going to, not just revolutionise the industry, but revolutionise sales training in general. it's going to be able to present different scenarios, to the training platform getting feedback and uploading their videos to train to where we can train hundreds of people at the same time. I mean guys, this software that you guys have helped bring to life is truly going to change the industry.; Sokolis Group has been working with AllianceTek for almost a decade. We partnered with them to design and build a proprietary application that is critical to our business for analyzing and reporting our clients' fuel transaction data. Over the years, we have continued to work with AllianceTek to develop new features which helped make our business more efficient and our reporting to clients more insightful. In addition, AllianceTek provides the hosting and maintenance for this cloud-based application and we trust them to handle this important responsibility. They are a valued partner to our business and I would not hesitate to recommend them.; I work for a boutique leadership and communication consulting firm. As part of our service offerings, we provide clients a private and secure performance / developmental review site where employees are able to provide one another feedback on a regular cadence. We initially used an internal site, but as the scale of our projects and clients began to increase, we knew we needed to increase the sophistication of our site. That's where AllianceTek came in. Working together hand-in-hand, we developed a site tailored to the needs of our clients. Since development of the site, we've had clients ask for increased personalization and customization, and AllianceTek has been able to help us develop these in an expedient and efficient manner. Another bonus is that even after several years of working together, we've had the same points of contact throughout. This has been an invaluable part of us working together so well. After the past few years of working together, I couldn't recommend AllianceTek highly enough.; ; AllianceTek has delivered outstanding products and services which has helped Strategas achieve outstanding recognition from our financial services clients. Beyond those technical achievements, what sets this team apart from the crowd is the rapid responsiveness to my requests, be it a production problem, coding change, or business challenge; that kind of responsiveness is an exceptional work ethic not frequently seen in our industry and highly valued by my firm. I can always count upon this team to respond in kind with their best efforts.; ; "

< $25/hr ",2017,"Being a developer, responsive testing comes as a part of the package, every time I develop a webpage. I have been relying over LambdaTest for responsive testing. They have a feature which allows me to capture full page screenshots of my webpages in scores of different devices. I could even capture web pages that are locally hosted. And now, they have come up with a browser that lets me not only capture screenshots but interact with my websites in 25+ different devices, in a side by side view. That allows me to test my website responsiveness on a bunch of devices in a live-interactive manner. I must admit I am highly impressed by the LT browser and I am a tough guy to impress.; We use LambdaTest across our development & testing team. Our developers always perform cross browser tests on their local pages across different browsers and their versions before sending them to the testers. The integrations with 3rd party tools make it more useful. It provides a full development environment that looks very close to the real thing.Before we started using LambdaTest, we're limited to the browsers and their versions that are available on our desktops and laptops. But now with LambdaTest, we are using Selenium grid of 2000+ browsers and their versions available on the platform.If you want a solution to replace testing infrastructure that is hard to main and look after, LambdaTest is the best solution according to us.; Have been using Lambdatest for around 1 year now, and could say that it’s a useful testing tool for our team. Offering great combinations of browsers and operating systems for you to test on and most importantly there are many types of additional logs that come with each test which helps in debugging.. Glad to see the integration with Travis CI due to which we could optimally use this tool with our CI CD pipelines directly. We were able to effectively run TestNG and Selenium tests using their documentation and as an added advantage their support team is quick and helpful.; The industry we function (e-commerce) has a broad category of audience. We need to make sure our website is accessible to everyone irrespective of the browser / operating system they use. Ofcourse, responsive web design check is a major bullet point over our testing checklist as well. As a B2C, it's crucial for us to stay ahead of the customers and we wanted a solution which could help us ensure our changes would work seamlessly when shipped to the Production. LambdaTest made a great fit here when considered the latest browsers on the product, ability to test local pages along with a complimentary access to LT browser which is an absolute delight for our developers and testers. It helps us save a considerable effort on responsive testing plus the native developer tools allow us to dig deep into any UI mismatch! Also As mentioned we could achieve wider test coverage in time by running multiple combinations of browsers in parallel with LambdaTest automation suite. Our director to purchase the subscription was due to their affordable pricing for the parallel tests and the communication from the support team!; Running tests serially can be a good option when your product is at an early stage. But as we scaled the product, we needed a tool to reduce test time execution and pace up our test cycles. LambdaTest simplified the Selenium testing experience for us with their cloud based platform which allowed us to execute our test cases in parallel on hundreds of browsers. We could easily automate the test cases, get the sessions recorded and share the test reports across the team for assessment using Asana integration. We even leverage the integration with CircleCI to run automated tests on LambdaTest through our pipeline. The CircleCI Orb is handy for testing our privately hosted application.It’s good to see now that using LambdaTest we could run multiple tests on multiple VM’s, saving us hours of testing time and maintenance cost of local infrastructure. Personally, one thing that LambdaTest does very well is continuing to provide tutorials for testing, so that we stay up to speed and are even able to learn new things.I definitely saw myself applying a lot of the new concepts that I learned from their blogs.; As technology advances, enterprises are switching from manual testing to Selenium Test Automation. But one area most enterprises are still struggling is with the scalability of running several tests in parallel. LambdaTest has been a boon for us when it comes to Selenium automation. With a Selenium Grid based on the cloud, we don't need to stress about setting up and maintaining infrastructure anymore. We can run hundreds of tests in parallel on 2000+ browsers and OS versions running on real machines. LambdaTest really helped us in reducing our web testing cost and at the same time scale it as and when required.To leverage on marketing campaigns, we needed to ensure all our deliverables render seamlessly on different mobile and desktop browsers our users use to view them from across the world. The geolocation testing functionality helped us set the location and test our website over various locations. At LambdaTest, we can now run geolocation testing to test our website across 40+ countries. The pricing plan is pretty simple and easy to grasp, with no hidden costs at all.; We needed a testing tool that was scalable enough to cover all the browsers and OS as per our clients requirement and at the same time integrate well into our workflow. Lambdatest provided us with the necessary features to meet our browser compatibility testing requirements. Without any hassle of configuring, installing or maintaining the virtual machines, we are able to launch local browser tests instantly. The best part is, Lambdatest also helps us run our Selenium based automated tests on its cloud infra - that too without burning a hole in our pocket. They offer extensive mobile and desktop browsers, thereby increasing our test coverage to maximum.; We serve a variety of clients across industries, thus we need to make sure our website is accessible from every desktop, mobile browser combination they use. Responsive web design is an integral part of our testing process. As a B2B, you want to make sure that your services are always a step ahead of your customers. And to achieve that, it's important to have a tool that keeps your code and web designing process in sync with the Production.LambdaTest's variety of browsers and local testing capabilities made it a perfect fit for our requirements. Additionally we got free access to LT Browser which is absolutely loved by our developers. We are now in a better position while tackling misbehaving websites with the help of it’s inbuilt dev tools. The best part is that LambdaTest offers an automated parallel testing that helped us achieve faster and wider test coverage over multiple browsers. Its affordable price and fast technical support made the purchase decision very easy for the team. And yes I absolutely love their support staff. They are truly available for 24*7.; While we develop our web applications, our top concern was to verify the unintentional changes to the application's visuals. We need to make sure that changing one component doesn't break the styling of another component. LambdaTest's Smart testing helped us to identify visual regression bugs for every new build. We could capture our website screenshots belonging to different environments i.e stage and production & upload them on the LambdaTest Visual Testing platform. We were able to discover visual deviations with pixel to pixel comparison by capturing screenshots, comparing them against the baseline image, and highlighting visual changes. The slider mode is very helpful to compare the visual discrepancies between the two images by toggling them. Overall, Smart testing helped us perform reliable visual testing at scale and eliminated the risk of delivering visual bugs."
Serverspace,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2019,"First of all I would like to thank Serverspace for this great platform! Out of other VPS services, this is my favorite, it offers me the flexibility to enhance my skills as a Full-Stack Developer as well as a server administrator. Well out of frustrations from other VPS services, since they have a lot of hassle to work on, this platform enabled me to easily pick my choice, add new memory capability just by a few clicks. I observed the great UI/UX of this platform, and I am planning to use this forever until this platform is still working.; I tried many cloud server providers like AWS, Azure, Google cloud and more but they didn't satisfy my needs but when I tried Serverspace I was shocked because of their server prices, for a startup that will be the best option, I saw that the price is low but the service is best as expensive, I am fully satisfied with this. I recommend Serverspace for startups once a time you see, a cybercriminal attacked my server in serverspace but... the company has reported me on time, so I saved my server from further attacks, Serverspace saved a lot of time and money.; What I like about this company is the many options offered to us customers since I'm a Windows/Linux User and most of my needs rely on multi-OS systems. That's why I run 4 servers with ServerSpace. Their Windows Machines are as good as you can imagine, they offer all the alternatives I need, and I also run servers with CentOS. With Serverspace, I can cover all my needs for my business, and the best part is I also have different options on the payment side. They only charge me for the current use and not a whole monthly amount in advance, and I can cancel any server I ordered at any second. Also, their support tickets get answered right away. It's pretty good. What I think they could do better is improve their automatic system detecting payments with Ever. Every time I pay with Ever, I have to send a support ticket with transaction ID and all info about the payment to add funds. I get a reply the same day, but I'd rather not have to notify it. I'm very happy with this service, and I'll; I tried six to seven cloud services before I settled with Serverspace. I am glad that I found it. All I need was a reliable, scalable, economical, and user-friendly server for my data crunching and web application. First, their pricing is way attractive. The bigger sites may start with some low teaser rates or even free credits, but their prices go up exponentially with more CPU and memory. Serverspace's pricing remains very reasonable. Granted they don't offer super big servers, I don't need them either. The other thing I like is that they charge significantly less when you turn off the server while other sites charge you the same. I like their simple offers; simple servers that let me build my own environments. The plethora of bells and whistles elsewhere turn me off. Their servers are generally reliable except they failed to turn on a couple of times. But they fixed it promptly and were responsive through the process. Their clean and intuitive web UI is helpful.; I work most of the time but I also trade forex to make some extra money. Since I am not always at home, I had to get an expert advisor for my trades and that was when I started looking for a reliable VPS service. I have been using Serverspace VPS for less than a year now and I can say it has been a peaceful experience in the sense that I never had to worry about shutting down of the server. It's very pocket-friendly and I like that I can pay daily as I use it. What I enjoy most is the option to shutdown a server without deleting or destroying it completely, that way I can restart the server when I need it and continue using it. Like I said, you only get charged for what you use. For a little fee, you also have the option to increase the size or speed of a VPS server if your work becomes bigger without having to get a new server. I can only hope to get more than 50 Mbps speed for the fixed plan as it takes more time to work when everything is so slow.; I have been using Serverspace for about 6 months now. System performance is good. I have never used a VPS before, so I need some help getting up and running. Support always answers back thru a support ticket, although you may have to wait up to 6 hours sometimes, the support is good. Their pricing has been great, and I plan to stay with the service.; Before I decided to use their servers to host our services, I checked out and tried many alternatives. Some time ago I found Serverspace at some offers comparer and I decided to give it a try and I'm really satisfied. There are no problems with servers which I met using servers from others. So at the moment, I think I will use Serverspace servers for my other projects and initiatives.; I like Serverspace! The relation between the purchase price and the performance is perfect. I like dealing with you because of the cheap prices and high performance. Also, the support team is fast, I always get my tickets resolved as fast as possible. The deployment of services is also fast. In general, I do have a good experience and would like to build a long-term relationship.; The uptime and the speed of the service are fantastic. The quality of support is second to none. Every time I need help, I get a very personalized answer and they always go the extra mile to solve my problem. I have tried many competitors in the past but none of them come close to the quality of service I am getting in Serverspace."

After interviewing multiple (8) companies, I selected Alliancetek because they were experienced, offered end to end solutions beyond a standard mobile app firm, and their price point was below competing firms.Alliancetek delivered on all promises with great professionalism. We had to pivot several times in the course of the project and each hurdle was handled without a hitch. My “team” consisted of 3 Alliancetek employees (1 project manager, 1 iOS developer, 1 Android developer) who I spoke with weekly through Microsoft Team meetings.

Since development of the site, we've had clients ask for increased personalization and customization, and AllianceTek has been able to help us develop these in an expedient and efficient manner.

From start to finish my interaction with the team at IndiaNIC was professional, stress-free and I had complete trust in their ability to deliver. Their difference is :1. They don't use templates as standard, so could custom built to match my vision and created a website set-up that was completely bespoke to my needs.2. They took the time to listen to what I wanted but also brought their own ideas, experience, and creativity so that the end design was more rounded.3. They understood that I needed to see things in a visual context and have some flexibility to 'play' around with a few ideas. All of this was done face to face at their offices making the process highly personal.4. Bhavin Bhatt took the lead on my website and was exceptional - communication was constant and quick, he explained in terms I could easily understand and he made the whole process so easy it was a pleasure to work with him.Thank you for a great customer experience and fantastic end result website!; They are professional and their employees are responsible and skilled.

LambdaTest,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2017,"Being a developer, responsive testing comes as a part of the package, every time I develop a webpage. I have been relying over LambdaTest for responsive testing. They have a feature which allows me to capture full page screenshots of my webpages in scores of different devices. I could even capture web pages that are locally hosted. And now, they have come up with a browser that lets me not only capture screenshots but interact with my websites in 25+ different devices, in a side by side view. That allows me to test my website responsiveness on a bunch of devices in a live-interactive manner. I must admit I am highly impressed by the LT browser and I am a tough guy to impress.; We use LambdaTest across our development & testing team. Our developers always perform cross browser tests on their local pages across different browsers and their versions before sending them to the testers. The integrations with 3rd party tools make it more useful. It provides a full development environment that looks very close to the real thing.Before we started using LambdaTest, we're limited to the browsers and their versions that are available on our desktops and laptops. But now with LambdaTest, we are using Selenium grid of 2000+ browsers and their versions available on the platform.If you want a solution to replace testing infrastructure that is hard to main and look after, LambdaTest is the best solution according to us.; Have been using Lambdatest for around 1 year now, and could say that it’s a useful testing tool for our team. Offering great combinations of browsers and operating systems for you to test on and most importantly there are many types of additional logs that come with each test which helps in debugging.. Glad to see the integration with Travis CI due to which we could optimally use this tool with our CI CD pipelines directly. We were able to effectively run TestNG and Selenium tests using their documentation and as an added advantage their support team is quick and helpful.; The industry we function (e-commerce) has a broad category of audience. We need to make sure our website is accessible to everyone irrespective of the browser / operating system they use. Ofcourse, responsive web design check is a major bullet point over our testing checklist as well. As a B2C, it's crucial for us to stay ahead of the customers and we wanted a solution which could help us ensure our changes would work seamlessly when shipped to the Production. LambdaTest made a great fit here when considered the latest browsers on the product, ability to test local pages along with a complimentary access to LT browser which is an absolute delight for our developers and testers. It helps us save a considerable effort on responsive testing plus the native developer tools allow us to dig deep into any UI mismatch! Also As mentioned we could achieve wider test coverage in time by running multiple combinations of browsers in parallel with LambdaTest automation suite. Our director to purchase the subscription was due to their affordable pricing for the parallel tests and the communication from the support team!; Running tests serially can be a good option when your product is at an early stage. But as we scaled the product, we needed a tool to reduce test time execution and pace up our test cycles. LambdaTest simplified the Selenium testing experience for us with their cloud based platform which allowed us to execute our test cases in parallel on hundreds of browsers. We could easily automate the test cases, get the sessions recorded and share the test reports across the team for assessment using Asana integration. We even leverage the integration with CircleCI to run automated tests on LambdaTest through our pipeline. The CircleCI Orb is handy for testing our privately hosted application.It’s good to see now that using LambdaTest we could run multiple tests on multiple VM’s, saving us hours of testing time and maintenance cost of local infrastructure. Personally, one thing that LambdaTest does very well is continuing to provide tutorials for testing, so that we stay up to speed and are even able to learn new things.I definitely saw myself applying a lot of the new concepts that I learned from their blogs.; As technology advances, enterprises are switching from manual testing to Selenium Test Automation. But one area most enterprises are still struggling is with the scalability of running several tests in parallel. LambdaTest has been a boon for us when it comes to Selenium automation. With a Selenium Grid based on the cloud, we don't need to stress about setting up and maintaining infrastructure anymore. We can run hundreds of tests in parallel on 2000+ browsers and OS versions running on real machines. LambdaTest really helped us in reducing our web testing cost and at the same time scale it as and when required.To leverage on marketing campaigns, we needed to ensure all our deliverables render seamlessly on different mobile and desktop browsers our users use to view them from across the world. The geolocation testing functionality helped us set the location and test our website over various locations. At LambdaTest, we can now run geolocation testing to test our website across 40+ countries. The pricing plan is pretty simple and easy to grasp, with no hidden costs at all.; We needed a testing tool that was scalable enough to cover all the browsers and OS as per our clients requirement and at the same time integrate well into our workflow. Lambdatest provided us with the necessary features to meet our browser compatibility testing requirements. Without any hassle of configuring, installing or maintaining the virtual machines, we are able to launch local browser tests instantly. The best part is, Lambdatest also helps us run our Selenium based automated tests on its cloud infra - that too without burning a hole in our pocket. They offer extensive mobile and desktop browsers, thereby increasing our test coverage to maximum.; We serve a variety of clients across industries, thus we need to make sure our website is accessible from every desktop, mobile browser combination they use. Responsive web design is an integral part of our testing process. As a B2B, you want to make sure that your services are always a step ahead of your customers. And to achieve that, it's important to have a tool that keeps your code and web designing process in sync with the Production.LambdaTest's variety of browsers and local testing capabilities made it a perfect fit for our requirements. Additionally we got free access to LT Browser which is absolutely loved by our developers. We are now in a better position while tackling misbehaving websites with the help of it’s inbuilt dev tools. The best part is that LambdaTest offers an automated parallel testing that helped us achieve faster and wider test coverage over multiple browsers. Its affordable price and fast technical support made the purchase decision very easy for the team. And yes I absolutely love their support staff. They are truly available for 24*7.; While we develop our web applications, our top concern was to verify the unintentional changes to the application's visuals. We need to make sure that changing one component doesn't break the styling of another component. LambdaTest's Smart testing helped us to identify visual regression bugs for every new build. We could capture our website screenshots belonging to different environments i.e stage and production & upload them on the LambdaTest Visual Testing platform. We were able to discover visual deviations with pixel to pixel comparison by capturing screenshots, comparing them against the baseline image, and highlighting visual changes. The slider mode is very helpful to compare the visual discrepancies between the two images by toggling them. Overall, Smart testing helped us perform reliable visual testing at scale and eliminated the risk of delivering visual bugs."
Serverspace,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2019,"First of all I would like to thank Serverspace for this great platform! Out of other VPS services, this is my favorite, it offers me the flexibility to enhance my skills as a Full-Stack Developer as well as a server administrator. Well out of frustrations from other VPS services, since they have a lot of hassle to work on, this platform enabled me to easily pick my choice, add new memory capability just by a few clicks. I observed the great UI/UX of this platform, and I am planning to use this forever until this platform is still working.; I tried many cloud server providers like AWS, Azure, Google cloud and more but they didn't satisfy my needs but when I tried Serverspace I was shocked because of their server prices, for a startup that will be the best option, I saw that the price is low but the service is best as expensive, I am fully satisfied with this. I recommend Serverspace for startups once a time you see, a cybercriminal attacked my server in serverspace but... the company has reported me on time, so I saved my server from further attacks, Serverspace saved a lot of time and money.; What I like about this company is the many options offered to us customers since I'm a Windows/Linux User and most of my needs rely on multi-OS systems. That's why I run 4 servers with ServerSpace. Their Windows Machines are as good as you can imagine, they offer all the alternatives I need, and I also run servers with CentOS. With Serverspace, I can cover all my needs for my business, and the best part is I also have different options on the payment side. They only charge me for the current use and not a whole monthly amount in advance, and I can cancel any server I ordered at any second. Also, their support tickets get answered right away. It's pretty good. What I think they could do better is improve their automatic system detecting payments with Ever. Every time I pay with Ever, I have to send a support ticket with transaction ID and all info about the payment to add funds. I get a reply the same day, but I'd rather not have to notify it. I'm very happy with this service, and I'll; I tried six to seven cloud services before I settled with Serverspace. I am glad that I found it. All I need was a reliable, scalable, economical, and user-friendly server for my data crunching and web application. First, their pricing is way attractive. The bigger sites may start with some low teaser rates or even free credits, but their prices go up exponentially with more CPU and memory. Serverspace's pricing remains very reasonable. Granted they don't offer super big servers, I don't need them either. The other thing I like is that they charge significantly less when you turn off the server while other sites charge you the same. I like their simple offers; simple servers that let me build my own environments. The plethora of bells and whistles elsewhere turn me off. Their servers are generally reliable except they failed to turn on a couple of times. But they fixed it promptly and were responsive through the process. Their clean and intuitive web UI is helpful.; I work most of the time but I also trade forex to make some extra money. Since I am not always at home, I had to get an expert advisor for my trades and that was when I started looking for a reliable VPS service. I have been using Serverspace VPS for less than a year now and I can say it has been a peaceful experience in the sense that I never had to worry about shutting down of the server. It's very pocket-friendly and I like that I can pay daily as I use it. What I enjoy most is the option to shutdown a server without deleting or destroying it completely, that way I can restart the server when I need it and continue using it. Like I said, you only get charged for what you use. For a little fee, you also have the option to increase the size or speed of a VPS server if your work becomes bigger without having to get a new server. I can only hope to get more than 50 Mbps speed for the fixed plan as it takes more time to work when everything is so slow.; I have been using Serverspace for about 6 months now. System performance is good. I have never used a VPS before, so I need some help getting up and running. Support always answers back thru a support ticket, although you may have to wait up to 6 hours sometimes, the support is good. Their pricing has been great, and I plan to stay with the service.; Before I decided to use their servers to host our services, I checked out and tried many alternatives. Some time ago I found Serverspace at some offers comparer and I decided to give it a try and I'm really satisfied. There are no problems with servers which I met using servers from others. So at the moment, I think I will use Serverspace servers for my other projects and initiatives.; I like Serverspace! The relation between the purchase price and the performance is perfect. I like dealing with you because of the cheap prices and high performance. Also, the support team is fast, I always get my tickets resolved as fast as possible. The deployment of services is also fast. In general, I do have a good experience and would like to build a long-term relationship.; The uptime and the speed of the service are fantastic. The quality of support is second to none. Every time I need help, I get a very personalized answer and they always go the extra mile to solve my problem. I have tried many competitors in the past but none of them come close to the quality of service I am getting in Serverspace."

After interviewing multiple (8) companies, I selected Alliancetek because they were experienced, offered end to end solutions beyond a standard mobile app firm, and their price point was below competing firms.Alliancetek delivered on all promises with great professionalism. We had to pivot several times in the course of the project and each hurdle was handled without a hitch. My “team” consisted of 3 Alliancetek employees (1 project manager, 1 iOS developer, 1 Android developer) who I spoke with weekly through Microsoft Team meetings.

This is going to, not just revolutionise the industry, but revolutionise sales training in general. it's going to be able to present different scenarios, to the training platform getting feedback and uploading their videos to train to where we can train hundreds of people at the same time. I mean guys, this software that you guys have helped bring to life is truly going to change the industry.; Sokolis Group has been working with AllianceTek for almost a decade. We partnered with them to design and build a proprietary application that is critical to our business for analyzing and reporting our clients' fuel transaction data. Over the years, we have continued to work with AllianceTek to develop new features which helped make our business more efficient and our reporting to clients more insightful. In addition, AllianceTek provides the hosting and maintenance for this cloud-based application and we trust them to handle this important responsibility. They are a valued partner to our business and I would not hesitate to recommend them.; I work for a boutique leadership and communication consulting firm. As part of our service offerings, we provide clients a private and secure performance / developmental review site where employees are able to provide one another feedback on a regular cadence. We initially used an internal site, but as the scale of our projects and clients began to increase, we knew we needed to increase the sophistication of our site. That's where AllianceTek came in. Working together hand-in-hand, we developed a site tailored to the needs of our clients. Since development of the site, we've had clients ask for increased personalization and customization, and AllianceTek has been able to help us develop these in an expedient and efficient manner. Another bonus is that even after several years of working together, we've had the same points of contact throughout. This has been an invaluable part of us working together so well. After the past few years of working together, I couldn't recommend AllianceTek highly enough.; ; AllianceTek has delivered outstanding products and services which has helped Strategas achieve outstanding recognition from our financial services clients. Beyond those technical achievements, what sets this team apart from the crowd is the rapid responsiveness to my requests, be it a production problem, coding change, or business challenge; that kind of responsiveness is an exceptional work ethic not frequently seen in our industry and highly valued by my firm. I can always count upon this team to respond in kind with their best efforts.; ; "

LambdaTest,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2017,"Being a developer, responsive testing comes as a part of the package, every time I develop a webpage. I have been relying over LambdaTest for responsive testing. They have a feature which allows me to capture full page screenshots of my webpages in scores of different devices. I could even capture web pages that are locally hosted. And now, they have come up with a browser that lets me not only capture screenshots but interact with my websites in 25+ different devices, in a side by side view. That allows me to test my website responsiveness on a bunch of devices in a live-interactive manner. I must admit I am highly impressed by the LT browser and I am a tough guy to impress.; We use LambdaTest across our development & testing team. Our developers always perform cross browser tests on their local pages across different browsers and their versions before sending them to the testers. The integrations with 3rd party tools make it more useful. It provides a full development environment that looks very close to the real thing.Before we started using LambdaTest, we're limited to the browsers and their versions that are available on our desktops and laptops. But now with LambdaTest, we are using Selenium grid of 2000+ browsers and their versions available on the platform.If you want a solution to replace testing infrastructure that is hard to main and look after, LambdaTest is the best solution according to us.; Have been using Lambdatest for around 1 year now, and could say that it’s a useful testing tool for our team. Offering great combinations of browsers and operating systems for you to test on and most importantly there are many types of additional logs that come with each test which helps in debugging.. Glad to see the integration with Travis CI due to which we could optimally use this tool with our CI CD pipelines directly. We were able to effectively run TestNG and Selenium tests using their documentation and as an added advantage their support team is quick and helpful.; The industry we function (e-commerce) has a broad category of audience. We need to make sure our website is accessible to everyone irrespective of the browser / operating system they use. Ofcourse, responsive web design check is a major bullet point over our testing checklist as well. As a B2C, it's crucial for us to stay ahead of the customers and we wanted a solution which could help us ensure our changes would work seamlessly when shipped to the Production. LambdaTest made a great fit here when considered the latest browsers on the product, ability to test local pages along with a complimentary access to LT browser which is an absolute delight for our developers and testers. It helps us save a considerable effort on responsive testing plus the native developer tools allow us to dig deep into any UI mismatch! Also As mentioned we could achieve wider test coverage in time by running multiple combinations of browsers in parallel with LambdaTest automation suite. Our director to purchase the subscription was due to their affordable pricing for the parallel tests and the communication from the support team!; Running tests serially can be a good option when your product is at an early stage. But as we scaled the product, we needed a tool to reduce test time execution and pace up our test cycles. LambdaTest simplified the Selenium testing experience for us with their cloud based platform which allowed us to execute our test cases in parallel on hundreds of browsers. We could easily automate the test cases, get the sessions recorded and share the test reports across the team for assessment using Asana integration. We even leverage the integration with CircleCI to run automated tests on LambdaTest through our pipeline. The CircleCI Orb is handy for testing our privately hosted application.It’s good to see now that using LambdaTest we could run multiple tests on multiple VM’s, saving us hours of testing time and maintenance cost of local infrastructure. Personally, one thing that LambdaTest does very well is continuing to provide tutorials for testing, so that we stay up to speed and are even able to learn new things.I definitely saw myself applying a lot of the new concepts that I learned from their blogs.; As technology advances, enterprises are switching from manual testing to Selenium Test Automation. But one area most enterprises are still struggling is with the scalability of running several tests in parallel. LambdaTest has been a boon for us when it comes to Selenium automation. With a Selenium Grid based on the cloud, we don't need to stress about setting up and maintaining infrastructure anymore. We can run hundreds of tests in parallel on 2000+ browsers and OS versions running on real machines. LambdaTest really helped us in reducing our web testing cost and at the same time scale it as and when required.To leverage on marketing campaigns, we needed to ensure all our deliverables render seamlessly on different mobile and desktop browsers our users use to view them from across the world. The geolocation testing functionality helped us set the location and test our website over various locations. At LambdaTest, we can now run geolocation testing to test our website across 40+ countries. The pricing plan is pretty simple and easy to grasp, with no hidden costs at all.; We needed a testing tool that was scalable enough to cover all the browsers and OS as per our clients requirement and at the same time integrate well into our workflow. Lambdatest provided us with the necessary features to meet our browser compatibility testing requirements. Without any hassle of configuring, installing or maintaining the virtual machines, we are able to launch local browser tests instantly. The best part is, Lambdatest also helps us run our Selenium based automated tests on its cloud infra - that too without burning a hole in our pocket. They offer extensive mobile and desktop browsers, thereby increasing our test coverage to maximum.; We serve a variety of clients across industries, thus we need to make sure our website is accessible from every desktop, mobile browser combination they use. Responsive web design is an integral part of our testing process. As a B2B, you want to make sure that your services are always a step ahead of your customers. And to achieve that, it's important to have a tool that keeps your code and web designing process in sync with the Production.LambdaTest's variety of browsers and local testing capabilities made it a perfect fit for our requirements. Additionally we got free access to LT Browser which is absolutely loved by our developers. We are now in a better position while tackling misbehaving websites with the help of it’s inbuilt dev tools. The best part is that LambdaTest offers an automated parallel testing that helped us achieve faster and wider test coverage over multiple browsers. Its affordable price and fast technical support made the purchase decision very easy for the team. And yes I absolutely love their support staff. They are truly available for 24*7.; While we develop our web applications, our top concern was to verify the unintentional changes to the application's visuals. We need to make sure that changing one component doesn't break the styling of another component. LambdaTest's Smart testing helped us to identify visual regression bugs for every new build. We could capture our website screenshots belonging to different environments i.e stage and production & upload them on the LambdaTest Visual Testing platform. We were able to discover visual deviations with pixel to pixel comparison by capturing screenshots, comparing them against the baseline image, and highlighting visual changes. The slider mode is very helpful to compare the visual discrepancies between the two images by toggling them. Overall, Smart testing helped us perform reliable visual testing at scale and eliminated the risk of delivering visual bugs."
Serverspace,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2019,"First of all I would like to thank Serverspace for this great platform! Out of other VPS services, this is my favorite, it offers me the flexibility to enhance my skills as a Full-Stack Developer as well as a server administrator. Well out of frustrations from other VPS services, since they have a lot of hassle to work on, this platform enabled me to easily pick my choice, add new memory capability just by a few clicks. I observed the great UI/UX of this platform, and I am planning to use this forever until this platform is still working.; I tried many cloud server providers like AWS, Azure, Google cloud and more but they didn't satisfy my needs but when I tried Serverspace I was shocked because of their server prices, for a startup that will be the best option, I saw that the price is low but the service is best as expensive, I am fully satisfied with this. I recommend Serverspace for startups once a time you see, a cybercriminal attacked my server in serverspace but... the company has reported me on time, so I saved my server from further attacks, Serverspace saved a lot of time and money.; What I like about this company is the many options offered to us customers since I'm a Windows/Linux User and most of my needs rely on multi-OS systems. That's why I run 4 servers with ServerSpace. Their Windows Machines are as good as you can imagine, they offer all the alternatives I need, and I also run servers with CentOS. With Serverspace, I can cover all my needs for my business, and the best part is I also have different options on the payment side. They only charge me for the current use and not a whole monthly amount in advance, and I can cancel any server I ordered at any second. Also, their support tickets get answered right away. It's pretty good. What I think they could do better is improve their automatic system detecting payments with Ever. Every time I pay with Ever, I have to send a support ticket with transaction ID and all info about the payment to add funds. I get a reply the same day, but I'd rather not have to notify it. I'm very happy with this service, and I'll; I tried six to seven cloud services before I settled with Serverspace. I am glad that I found it. All I need was a reliable, scalable, economical, and user-friendly server for my data crunching and web application. First, their pricing is way attractive. The bigger sites may start with some low teaser rates or even free credits, but their prices go up exponentially with more CPU and memory. Serverspace's pricing remains very reasonable. Granted they don't offer super big servers, I don't need them either. The other thing I like is that they charge significantly less when you turn off the server while other sites charge you the same. I like their simple offers; simple servers that let me build my own environments. The plethora of bells and whistles elsewhere turn me off. Their servers are generally reliable except they failed to turn on a couple of times. But they fixed it promptly and were responsive through the process. Their clean and intuitive web UI is helpful.; I work most of the time but I also trade forex to make some extra money. Since I am not always at home, I had to get an expert advisor for my trades and that was when I started looking for a reliable VPS service. I have been using Serverspace VPS for less than a year now and I can say it has been a peaceful experience in the sense that I never had to worry about shutting down of the server. It's very pocket-friendly and I like that I can pay daily as I use it. What I enjoy most is the option to shutdown a server without deleting or destroying it completely, that way I can restart the server when I need it and continue using it. Like I said, you only get charged for what you use. For a little fee, you also have the option to increase the size or speed of a VPS server if your work becomes bigger without having to get a new server. I can only hope to get more than 50 Mbps speed for the fixed plan as it takes more time to work when everything is so slow.; I have been using Serverspace for about 6 months now. System performance is good. I have never used a VPS before, so I need some help getting up and running. Support always answers back thru a support ticket, although you may have to wait up to 6 hours sometimes, the support is good. Their pricing has been great, and I plan to stay with the service.; Before I decided to use their servers to host our services, I checked out and tried many alternatives. Some time ago I found Serverspace at some offers comparer and I decided to give it a try and I'm really satisfied. There are no problems with servers which I met using servers from others. So at the moment, I think I will use Serverspace servers for my other projects and initiatives.; I like Serverspace! The relation between the purchase price and the performance is perfect. I like dealing with you because of the cheap prices and high performance. Also, the support team is fast, I always get my tickets resolved as fast as possible. The deployment of services is also fast. In general, I do have a good experience and would like to build a long-term relationship.; The uptime and the speed of the service are fantastic. The quality of support is second to none. Every time I need help, I get a very personalized answer and they always go the extra mile to solve my problem. I have tried many competitors in the past but none of them come close to the quality of service I am getting in Serverspace."

MetaDesign Solutions,cloud-computing-companies,"
 $50 - $99/hr ",2007,"We selected MetaDesign after evaluating several firms that each proposed a solution for our needs. MetaDesign worked with us throughout the process, providing recommendations on best practices, prototyping, development, and testing. They set up a cloud environment and provide a hosted solution including support on an ongoing basis. We had a team lead who worked with us directly and other developers as needed. We use the software on a daily basis in connection with our production process. It reliably performs exactly the function we need it to perform.Our team lead is responsive and available, reliably delivering work products on time. MetaDesign is responsive, they know what to do and they do what they say they are going to do!We are very satisfied with MetaDesign.; I have been working with MetaDesign Solutions for many years now and I can confidently say that this is one of the best companies that I've ever come across. The team is very professional and responsive, they work hard to understand the vision of their clients, and they provide excellent quality. They also help me design my app in a cost-effective manner. I highly recommend MetaDesign Solutions to anyone who needs an app or software development company; Have worked with Metadesign on multiple projects for more than 5 years now.

Would certainly recommend them to others; I highly recommend Amit and his team to anyone looking for a knowledgeable developer who is easy to work with and can quickly build a sophisticated scalable product. Throughout the development process, they became part of my team and were extremely proactive in tweaking and improving the product based on customer feedback.

It was a pleasure working with them and highly recommend them to everyone.; We decided to work with MetaDesign Solutions for our project as we found their offer appealing as well as affordable, especially considering our requirements.

The final project was delivered and implemented without major complications. Currently the Codebay team provides us with support and system updates.; We hire them for the development of a web application. A member of their team, Luis Sanchez was in charge of the project, we had several meetings to define the content and structure of the first sites.

However, for the most part, they've completed things in a timely manner or even ahead of schedule.; We started working with a cloud specialist, who reviewed our current systems and implemented a work plan to migrate to the cloud.

Eventually we managed to migrate everything, and from there Codebay has provided us with maintenance services.; We start by planning the different stages of development with the support of an architect and the design area. We already had a system made in .NET, so the new platform was programmed in the same language. The development had different variables which took a year to complete, currently we continue working with them with support and system improvements.; We have worked together for a few months and it has been a positive experience, the team besides being very committed to development, they have shown good technical skills.

The app is a social media platform for investing with back end analytics similar to Twitter. The development required integration with a high end data provider and a separate charting platform. After interviewing multiple (8) companies, I selected Alliancetek because they were experienced, offered end to end solutions beyond a standard mobile app firm, and their price point was below competing firms.Alliancetek delivered on all promises with great professionalism. We had to pivot several times in the course of the project and each hurdle was handled without a hitch. My “team” consisted of 3 Alliancetek employees (1 project manager, 1 iOS developer, 1 Android developer) who I spoke with weekly through Microsoft Team meetings. There were additional back end developers who worked on the project. I had an outstanding experience and give Alliancetek my highest recommendation.; My company was close to the launch date for a software platform that allows aspiring US college athletes to get recruited. It was a complex system involving many different elements, user types and features. With our primary in-house developer, we were running very late on our development schedule. We had a few months left to finish off the system before our customers began to use it. We brought AllianceTek on and they helped us get over the line with their amazing, responsive and high quality work. Without their tremendous work, we would not have been able to get over the line and give our customers a product that would be helpful to them. AllianceTek were honestly a game changer, and I could not imagine being where we are today as a company without their heavy and continued involvement.; The project has moved extremely smooth. The communication, the Dev team, I mean all of you guys over at Alliance Tech have just blown away my expectations and I can't thank you guys enough for helping me bring this idea into a reality. This is going to, not just revolutionise the industry, but revolutionise sales training in general. it's going to be able to present different scenarios, to the training platform getting feedback and uploading their videos to train to where we can train hundreds of people at the same time. I mean guys, this software that you guys have helped bring to life is truly going to change the industry.; Sokolis Group has been working with AllianceTek for almost a decade. We partnered with them to design and build a proprietary application that is critical to our business for analyzing and reporting our clients' fuel transaction data. Over the years, we have continued to work with AllianceTek to develop new features which helped make our business more efficient and our reporting to clients more insightful. In addition, AllianceTek provides the hosting and maintenance for this cloud-based application and we trust them to handle this important responsibility. They are a valued partner to our business and I would not hesitate to recommend them.; I work for a boutique leadership and communication consulting firm. As part of our service offerings, we provide clients a private and secure performance / developmental review site where employees are able to provide one another feedback on a regular cadence. We initially used an internal site, but as the scale of our projects and clients began to increase, we knew we needed to increase the sophistication of our site. That's where AllianceTek came in. Working together hand-in-hand, we developed a site tailored to the needs of our clients. Since development of the site, we've had clients ask for increased personalization and customization, and AllianceTek has been able to help us develop these in an expedient and efficient manner. Another bonus is that even after several years of working together, we've had the same points of contact throughout. This has been an invaluable part of us working together so well. After the past few years of working together, I couldn't recommend AllianceTek highly enough.; ; AllianceTek has delivered outstanding products and services which has helped Strategas achieve outstanding recognition from our financial services clients. Beyond those technical achievements, what sets this team apart from the crowd is the rapid responsiveness to my requests, be it a production problem, coding change, or business challenge; that kind of responsiveness is an exceptional work ethic not frequently seen in our industry and highly valued by my firm. I can always count upon this team to respond in kind with their best efforts.; ; "

LambdaTest,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2017,"Being a developer, responsive testing comes as a part of the package, every time I develop a webpage. I have been relying over LambdaTest for responsive testing. They have a feature which allows me to capture full page screenshots of my webpages in scores of different devices. I could even capture web pages that are locally hosted. And now, they have come up with a browser that lets me not only capture screenshots but interact with my websites in 25+ different devices, in a side by side view. That allows me to test my website responsiveness on a bunch of devices in a live-interactive manner. I must admit I am highly impressed by the LT browser and I am a tough guy to impress.; We use LambdaTest across our development & testing team. Our developers always perform cross browser tests on their local pages across different browsers and their versions before sending them to the testers. The integrations with 3rd party tools make it more useful. It provides a full development environment that looks very close to the real thing.Before we started using LambdaTest, we're limited to the browsers and their versions that are available on our desktops and laptops. But now with LambdaTest, we are using Selenium grid of 2000+ browsers and their versions available on the platform.If you want a solution to replace testing infrastructure that is hard to main and look after, LambdaTest is the best solution according to us.; Have been using Lambdatest for around 1 year now, and could say that it’s a useful testing tool for our team. Offering great combinations of browsers and operating systems for you to test on and most importantly there are many types of additional logs that come with each test which helps in debugging.. Glad to see the integration with Travis CI due to which we could optimally use this tool with our CI CD pipelines directly. We were able to effectively run TestNG and Selenium tests using their documentation and as an added advantage their support team is quick and helpful.; The industry we function (e-commerce) has a broad category of audience. We need to make sure our website is accessible to everyone irrespective of the browser / operating system they use. Ofcourse, responsive web design check is a major bullet point over our testing checklist as well. As a B2C, it's crucial for us to stay ahead of the customers and we wanted a solution which could help us ensure our changes would work seamlessly when shipped to the Production. LambdaTest made a great fit here when considered the latest browsers on the product, ability to test local pages along with a complimentary access to LT browser which is an absolute delight for our developers and testers. It helps us save a considerable effort on responsive testing plus the native developer tools allow us to dig deep into any UI mismatch! Also As mentioned we could achieve wider test coverage in time by running multiple combinations of browsers in parallel with LambdaTest automation suite. Our director to purchase the subscription was due to their affordable pricing for the parallel tests and the communication from the support team!; Running tests serially can be a good option when your product is at an early stage. But as we scaled the product, we needed a tool to reduce test time execution and pace up our test cycles. LambdaTest simplified the Selenium testing experience for us with their cloud based platform which allowed us to execute our test cases in parallel on hundreds of browsers. We could easily automate the test cases, get the sessions recorded and share the test reports across the team for assessment using Asana integration. We even leverage the integration with CircleCI to run automated tests on LambdaTest through our pipeline. The CircleCI Orb is handy for testing our privately hosted application.It’s good to see now that using LambdaTest we could run multiple tests on multiple VM’s, saving us hours of testing time and maintenance cost of local infrastructure. Personally, one thing that LambdaTest does very well is continuing to provide tutorials for testing, so that we stay up to speed and are even able to learn new things.I definitely saw myself applying a lot of the new concepts that I learned from their blogs.; As technology advances, enterprises are switching from manual testing to Selenium Test Automation. But one area most enterprises are still struggling is with the scalability of running several tests in parallel. LambdaTest has been a boon for us when it comes to Selenium automation. With a Selenium Grid based on the cloud, we don't need to stress about setting up and maintaining infrastructure anymore. We can run hundreds of tests in parallel on 2000+ browsers and OS versions running on real machines. LambdaTest really helped us in reducing our web testing cost and at the same time scale it as and when required.To leverage on marketing campaigns, we needed to ensure all our deliverables render seamlessly on different mobile and desktop browsers our users use to view them from across the world. The geolocation testing functionality helped us set the location and test our website over various locations. At LambdaTest, we can now run geolocation testing to test our website across 40+ countries. The pricing plan is pretty simple and easy to grasp, with no hidden costs at all.; We needed a testing tool that was scalable enough to cover all the browsers and OS as per our clients requirement and at the same time integrate well into our workflow. Lambdatest provided us with the necessary features to meet our browser compatibility testing requirements. Without any hassle of configuring, installing or maintaining the virtual machines, we are able to launch local browser tests instantly. The best part is, Lambdatest also helps us run our Selenium based automated tests on its cloud infra - that too without burning a hole in our pocket. They offer extensive mobile and desktop browsers, thereby increasing our test coverage to maximum.; We serve a variety of clients across industries, thus we need to make sure our website is accessible from every desktop, mobile browser combination they use. Responsive web design is an integral part of our testing process. As a B2B, you want to make sure that your services are always a step ahead of your customers. And to achieve that, it's important to have a tool that keeps your code and web designing process in sync with the Production.LambdaTest's variety of browsers and local testing capabilities made it a perfect fit for our requirements. Additionally we got free access to LT Browser which is absolutely loved by our developers. We are now in a better position while tackling misbehaving websites with the help of it’s inbuilt dev tools. The best part is that LambdaTest offers an automated parallel testing that helped us achieve faster and wider test coverage over multiple browsers. Its affordable price and fast technical support made the purchase decision very easy for the team. And yes I absolutely love their support staff. They are truly available for 24*7.; While we develop our web applications, our top concern was to verify the unintentional changes to the application's visuals. We need to make sure that changing one component doesn't break the styling of another component. LambdaTest's Smart testing helped us to identify visual regression bugs for every new build. We could capture our website screenshots belonging to different environments i.e stage and production & upload them on the LambdaTest Visual Testing platform. We were able to discover visual deviations with pixel to pixel comparison by capturing screenshots, comparing them against the baseline image, and highlighting visual changes. The slider mode is very helpful to compare the visual discrepancies between the two images by toggling them. Overall, Smart testing helped us perform reliable visual testing at scale and eliminated the risk of delivering visual bugs."
Serverspace,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2019,"First of all I would like to thank Serverspace for this great platform! Out of other VPS services, this is my favorite, it offers me the flexibility to enhance my skills as a Full-Stack Developer as well as a server administrator. Well out of frustrations from other VPS services, since they have a lot of hassle to work on, this platform enabled me to easily pick my choice, add new memory capability just by a few clicks. I observed the great UI/UX of this platform, and I am planning to use this forever until this platform is still working.; I tried many cloud server providers like AWS, Azure, Google cloud and more but they didn't satisfy my needs but when I tried Serverspace I was shocked because of their server prices, for a startup that will be the best option, I saw that the price is low but the service is best as expensive, I am fully satisfied with this. I recommend Serverspace for startups once a time you see, a cybercriminal attacked my server in serverspace but... the company has reported me on time, so I saved my server from further attacks, Serverspace saved a lot of time and money.; What I like about this company is the many options offered to us customers since I'm a Windows/Linux User and most of my needs rely on multi-OS systems. That's why I run 4 servers with ServerSpace. Their Windows Machines are as good as you can imagine, they offer all the alternatives I need, and I also run servers with CentOS. With Serverspace, I can cover all my needs for my business, and the best part is I also have different options on the payment side. They only charge me for the current use and not a whole monthly amount in advance, and I can cancel any server I ordered at any second. Also, their support tickets get answered right away. It's pretty good. What I think they could do better is improve their automatic system detecting payments with Ever. Every time I pay with Ever, I have to send a support ticket with transaction ID and all info about the payment to add funds. I get a reply the same day, but I'd rather not have to notify it. I'm very happy with this service, and I'll; I tried six to seven cloud services before I settled with Serverspace. I am glad that I found it. All I need was a reliable, scalable, economical, and user-friendly server for my data crunching and web application. First, their pricing is way attractive. The bigger sites may start with some low teaser rates or even free credits, but their prices go up exponentially with more CPU and memory. Serverspace's pricing remains very reasonable. Granted they don't offer super big servers, I don't need them either. The other thing I like is that they charge significantly less when you turn off the server while other sites charge you the same. I like their simple offers; simple servers that let me build my own environments. The plethora of bells and whistles elsewhere turn me off. Their servers are generally reliable except they failed to turn on a couple of times. But they fixed it promptly and were responsive through the process. Their clean and intuitive web UI is helpful.; I work most of the time but I also trade forex to make some extra money. Since I am not always at home, I had to get an expert advisor for my trades and that was when I started looking for a reliable VPS service. I have been using Serverspace VPS for less than a year now and I can say it has been a peaceful experience in the sense that I never had to worry about shutting down of the server. It's very pocket-friendly and I like that I can pay daily as I use it. What I enjoy most is the option to shutdown a server without deleting or destroying it completely, that way I can restart the server when I need it and continue using it. Like I said, you only get charged for what you use. For a little fee, you also have the option to increase the size or speed of a VPS server if your work becomes bigger without having to get a new server. I can only hope to get more than 50 Mbps speed for the fixed plan as it takes more time to work when everything is so slow.; I have been using Serverspace for about 6 months now. System performance is good. I have never used a VPS before, so I need some help getting up and running. Support always answers back thru a support ticket, although you may have to wait up to 6 hours sometimes, the support is good. Their pricing has been great, and I plan to stay with the service.; Before I decided to use their servers to host our services, I checked out and tried many alternatives. Some time ago I found Serverspace at some offers comparer and I decided to give it a try and I'm really satisfied. There are no problems with servers which I met using servers from others. So at the moment, I think I will use Serverspace servers for my other projects and initiatives.; I like Serverspace! The relation between the purchase price and the performance is perfect. I like dealing with you because of the cheap prices and high performance. Also, the support team is fast, I always get my tickets resolved as fast as possible. The deployment of services is also fast. In general, I do have a good experience and would like to build a long-term relationship.; The uptime and the speed of the service are fantastic. The quality of support is second to none. Every time I need help, I get a very personalized answer and they always go the extra mile to solve my problem. I have tried many competitors in the past but none of them come close to the quality of service I am getting in Serverspace."

After interviewing multiple (8) companies, I selected Alliancetek because they were experienced, offered end to end solutions beyond a standard mobile app firm, and their price point was below competing firms.Alliancetek delivered on all promises with great professionalism. We had to pivot several times in the course of the project and each hurdle was handled without a hitch. My “team” consisted of 3 Alliancetek employees (1 project manager, 1 iOS developer, 1 Android developer) who I spoke with weekly through Microsoft Team meetings.

Since development of the site, we've had clients ask for increased personalization and customization, and AllianceTek has been able to help us develop these in an expedient and efficient manner.

From start to finish my interaction with the team at IndiaNIC was professional, stress-free and I had complete trust in their ability to deliver. Their difference is :1. They don't use templates as standard, so could custom built to match my vision and created a website set-up that was completely bespoke to my needs.2. They took the time to listen to what I wanted but also brought their own ideas, experience, and creativity so that the end design was more rounded.3. They understood that I needed to see things in a visual context and have some flexibility to 'play' around with a few ideas. All of this was done face to face at their offices making the process highly personal.4. Bhavin Bhatt took the lead on my website and was exceptional - communication was constant and quick, he explained in terms I could easily understand and he made the whole process so easy it was a pleasure to work with him.Thank you for a great customer experience and fantastic end result website!; They are professional and their employees are responsible and skilled.

They promised us to give the 50% discount so my whole team was shocked after hear such comment we were not ready to believe them, but that was our myth as they completed our application in just 4 weeks with 50% payment only. This thing forced me to share my experience over here , I believe that Perfectiongeeks is going to be the best IT company in the coming years. Highly recommendable as they proved they are not only behind the money, and will always be stick on their words.

The entire team work without the advance money. And on the 1st advance payment which is already 30 days from the start the back-end team already completed the 50% of the entire project. I mean the entire team is so much dedicated that they work without question. They simply take my opinion and rest they take care of everything, I need not to them anything on the daily basis. Even though the application is delivered now if I want any small change they never ask for additional money. The reason of going with the PerfectionGeeks Technologies was the only one. The Director of the company, Shrey Bhardwaj is really a nice person and knowledgeable. He explained and developed my application himself.

LambdaTest,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2017,"Being a developer, responsive testing comes as a part of the package, every time I develop a webpage. I have been relying over LambdaTest for responsive testing. They have a feature which allows me to capture full page screenshots of my webpages in scores of different devices. I could even capture web pages that are locally hosted. And now, they have come up with a browser that lets me not only capture screenshots but interact with my websites in 25+ different devices, in a side by side view. That allows me to test my website responsiveness on a bunch of devices in a live-interactive manner. I must admit I am highly impressed by the LT browser and I am a tough guy to impress.; We use LambdaTest across our development & testing team. Our developers always perform cross browser tests on their local pages across different browsers and their versions before sending them to the testers. The integrations with 3rd party tools make it more useful. It provides a full development environment that looks very close to the real thing.Before we started using LambdaTest, we're limited to the browsers and their versions that are available on our desktops and laptops. But now with LambdaTest, we are using Selenium grid of 2000+ browsers and their versions available on the platform.If you want a solution to replace testing infrastructure that is hard to main and look after, LambdaTest is the best solution according to us.; Have been using Lambdatest for around 1 year now, and could say that it’s a useful testing tool for our team. Offering great combinations of browsers and operating systems for you to test on and most importantly there are many types of additional logs that come with each test which helps in debugging.. Glad to see the integration with Travis CI due to which we could optimally use this tool with our CI CD pipelines directly. We were able to effectively run TestNG and Selenium tests using their documentation and as an added advantage their support team is quick and helpful.; The industry we function (e-commerce) has a broad category of audience. We need to make sure our website is accessible to everyone irrespective of the browser / operating system they use. Ofcourse, responsive web design check is a major bullet point over our testing checklist as well. As a B2C, it's crucial for us to stay ahead of the customers and we wanted a solution which could help us ensure our changes would work seamlessly when shipped to the Production. LambdaTest made a great fit here when considered the latest browsers on the product, ability to test local pages along with a complimentary access to LT browser which is an absolute delight for our developers and testers. It helps us save a considerable effort on responsive testing plus the native developer tools allow us to dig deep into any UI mismatch! Also As mentioned we could achieve wider test coverage in time by running multiple combinations of browsers in parallel with LambdaTest automation suite. Our director to purchase the subscription was due to their affordable pricing for the parallel tests and the communication from the support team!; Running tests serially can be a good option when your product is at an early stage. But as we scaled the product, we needed a tool to reduce test time execution and pace up our test cycles. LambdaTest simplified the Selenium testing experience for us with their cloud based platform which allowed us to execute our test cases in parallel on hundreds of browsers. We could easily automate the test cases, get the sessions recorded and share the test reports across the team for assessment using Asana integration. We even leverage the integration with CircleCI to run automated tests on LambdaTest through our pipeline. The CircleCI Orb is handy for testing our privately hosted application.It’s good to see now that using LambdaTest we could run multiple tests on multiple VM’s, saving us hours of testing time and maintenance cost of local infrastructure. Personally, one thing that LambdaTest does very well is continuing to provide tutorials for testing, so that we stay up to speed and are even able to learn new things.I definitely saw myself applying a lot of the new concepts that I learned from their blogs.; As technology advances, enterprises are switching from manual testing to Selenium Test Automation. But one area most enterprises are still struggling is with the scalability of running several tests in parallel. LambdaTest has been a boon for us when it comes to Selenium automation. With a Selenium Grid based on the cloud, we don't need to stress about setting up and maintaining infrastructure anymore. We can run hundreds of tests in parallel on 2000+ browsers and OS versions running on real machines. LambdaTest really helped us in reducing our web testing cost and at the same time scale it as and when required.To leverage on marketing campaigns, we needed to ensure all our deliverables render seamlessly on different mobile and desktop browsers our users use to view them from across the world. The geolocation testing functionality helped us set the location and test our website over various locations. At LambdaTest, we can now run geolocation testing to test our website across 40+ countries. The pricing plan is pretty simple and easy to grasp, with no hidden costs at all.; We needed a testing tool that was scalable enough to cover all the browsers and OS as per our clients requirement and at the same time integrate well into our workflow. Lambdatest provided us with the necessary features to meet our browser compatibility testing requirements. Without any hassle of configuring, installing or maintaining the virtual machines, we are able to launch local browser tests instantly. The best part is, Lambdatest also helps us run our Selenium based automated tests on its cloud infra - that too without burning a hole in our pocket. They offer extensive mobile and desktop browsers, thereby increasing our test coverage to maximum.; We serve a variety of clients across industries, thus we need to make sure our website is accessible from every desktop, mobile browser combination they use. Responsive web design is an integral part of our testing process. As a B2B, you want to make sure that your services are always a step ahead of your customers. And to achieve that, it's important to have a tool that keeps your code and web designing process in sync with the Production.LambdaTest's variety of browsers and local testing capabilities made it a perfect fit for our requirements. Additionally we got free access to LT Browser which is absolutely loved by our developers. We are now in a better position while tackling misbehaving websites with the help of it’s inbuilt dev tools. The best part is that LambdaTest offers an automated parallel testing that helped us achieve faster and wider test coverage over multiple browsers. Its affordable price and fast technical support made the purchase decision very easy for the team. And yes I absolutely love their support staff. They are truly available for 24*7.; While we develop our web applications, our top concern was to verify the unintentional changes to the application's visuals. We need to make sure that changing one component doesn't break the styling of another component. LambdaTest's Smart testing helped us to identify visual regression bugs for every new build. We could capture our website screenshots belonging to different environments i.e stage and production & upload them on the LambdaTest Visual Testing platform. We were able to discover visual deviations with pixel to pixel comparison by capturing screenshots, comparing them against the baseline image, and highlighting visual changes. The slider mode is very helpful to compare the visual discrepancies between the two images by toggling them. Overall, Smart testing helped us perform reliable visual testing at scale and eliminated the risk of delivering visual bugs."
Serverspace,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2019,"First of all I would like to thank Serverspace for this great platform! Out of other VPS services, this is my favorite, it offers me the flexibility to enhance my skills as a Full-Stack Developer as well as a server administrator. Well out of frustrations from other VPS services, since they have a lot of hassle to work on, this platform enabled me to easily pick my choice, add new memory capability just by a few clicks. I observed the great UI/UX of this platform, and I am planning to use this forever until this platform is still working.; I tried many cloud server providers like AWS, Azure, Google cloud and more but they didn't satisfy my needs but when I tried Serverspace I was shocked because of their server prices, for a startup that will be the best option, I saw that the price is low but the service is best as expensive, I am fully satisfied with this. I recommend Serverspace for startups once a time you see, a cybercriminal attacked my server in serverspace but... the company has reported me on time, so I saved my server from further attacks, Serverspace saved a lot of time and money.; What I like about this company is the many options offered to us customers since I'm a Windows/Linux User and most of my needs rely on multi-OS systems. That's why I run 4 servers with ServerSpace. Their Windows Machines are as good as you can imagine, they offer all the alternatives I need, and I also run servers with CentOS. With Serverspace, I can cover all my needs for my business, and the best part is I also have different options on the payment side. They only charge me for the current use and not a whole monthly amount in advance, and I can cancel any server I ordered at any second. Also, their support tickets get answered right away. It's pretty good. What I think they could do better is improve their automatic system detecting payments with Ever. Every time I pay with Ever, I have to send a support ticket with transaction ID and all info about the payment to add funds. I get a reply the same day, but I'd rather not have to notify it. I'm very happy with this service, and I'll; I tried six to seven cloud services before I settled with Serverspace. I am glad that I found it. All I need was a reliable, scalable, economical, and user-friendly server for my data crunching and web application. First, their pricing is way attractive. The bigger sites may start with some low teaser rates or even free credits, but their prices go up exponentially with more CPU and memory. Serverspace's pricing remains very reasonable. Granted they don't offer super big servers, I don't need them either. The other thing I like is that they charge significantly less when you turn off the server while other sites charge you the same. I like their simple offers; simple servers that let me build my own environments. The plethora of bells and whistles elsewhere turn me off. Their servers are generally reliable except they failed to turn on a couple of times. But they fixed it promptly and were responsive through the process. Their clean and intuitive web UI is helpful.; I work most of the time but I also trade forex to make some extra money. Since I am not always at home, I had to get an expert advisor for my trades and that was when I started looking for a reliable VPS service. I have been using Serverspace VPS for less than a year now and I can say it has been a peaceful experience in the sense that I never had to worry about shutting down of the server. It's very pocket-friendly and I like that I can pay daily as I use it. What I enjoy most is the option to shutdown a server without deleting or destroying it completely, that way I can restart the server when I need it and continue using it. Like I said, you only get charged for what you use. For a little fee, you also have the option to increase the size or speed of a VPS server if your work becomes bigger without having to get a new server. I can only hope to get more than 50 Mbps speed for the fixed plan as it takes more time to work when everything is so slow.; I have been using Serverspace for about 6 months now. System performance is good. I have never used a VPS before, so I need some help getting up and running. Support always answers back thru a support ticket, although you may have to wait up to 6 hours sometimes, the support is good. Their pricing has been great, and I plan to stay with the service.; Before I decided to use their servers to host our services, I checked out and tried many alternatives. Some time ago I found Serverspace at some offers comparer and I decided to give it a try and I'm really satisfied. There are no problems with servers which I met using servers from others. So at the moment, I think I will use Serverspace servers for my other projects and initiatives.; I like Serverspace! The relation between the purchase price and the performance is perfect. I like dealing with you because of the cheap prices and high performance. Also, the support team is fast, I always get my tickets resolved as fast as possible. The deployment of services is also fast. In general, I do have a good experience and would like to build a long-term relationship.; The uptime and the speed of the service are fantastic. The quality of support is second to none. Every time I need help, I get a very personalized answer and they always go the extra mile to solve my problem. I have tried many competitors in the past but none of them come close to the quality of service I am getting in Serverspace."

The final project was delivered and implemented without major complications. Currently the Codebay team provides us with support and system updates.; We hire them for the development of a web application. A member of their team, Luis Sanchez was in charge of the project, we had several meetings to define the content and structure of the first sites. Later, he presented us graphic proposals and based on this, they began to develop. During development there were adjustments; Comparing them with the company I had worked with before, their communications are way superior.

However, for the most part, they've completed things in a timely manner or even ahead of schedule.; We started working with a cloud specialist, who reviewed our current systems and implemented a work plan to migrate to the cloud.

$25 - $49/hr ",2004,"We are a startup fintech company and needed to develop a mobile app in iOS and Android. The app is a social media platform for investing with back end analytics similar to Twitter. The development required integration with a high end data provider and a separate charting platform. After interviewing multiple (8) companies, I selected Alliancetek because they were experienced, offered end to end solutions beyond a standard mobile app firm, and their price point was below competing firms.Alliancetek delivered on all promises with great professionalism. We had to pivot several times in the course of the project and each hurdle was handled without a hitch. My “team” consisted of 3 Alliancetek employees (1 project manager, 1 iOS developer, 1 Android developer) who I spoke with weekly through Microsoft Team meetings. There were additional back end developers who worked on the project. I had an outstanding experience and give Alliancetek my highest recommendation.; My company was close to the launch date for a software platform that allows aspiring US college athletes to get recruited. It was a complex system involving many different elements, user types and features. With our primary in-house developer, we were running very late on our development schedule. We had a few months left to finish off the system before our customers began to use it. We brought AllianceTek on and they helped us get over the line with their amazing, responsive and high quality work. Without their tremendous work, we would not have been able to get over the line and give our customers a product that would be helpful to them. AllianceTek were honestly a game changer, and I could not imagine being where we are today as a company without their heavy and continued involvement.; The project has moved extremely smooth. The communication, the Dev team, I mean all of you guys over at Alliance Tech have just blown away my expectations and I can't thank you guys enough for helping me bring this idea into a reality. This is going to, not just revolutionise the industry, but revolutionise sales training in general. it's going to be able to present different scenarios, to the training platform getting feedback and uploading their videos to train to where we can train hundreds of people at the same time. I mean guys, this software that you guys have helped bring to life is truly going to change the industry.; Sokolis Group has been working with AllianceTek for almost a decade. We partnered with them to design and build a proprietary application that is critical to our business for analyzing and reporting our clients' fuel transaction data. Over the years, we have continued to work with AllianceTek to develop new features which helped make our business more efficient and our reporting to clients more insightful. In addition, AllianceTek provides the hosting and maintenance for this cloud-based application and we trust them to handle this important responsibility. They are a valued partner to our business and I would not hesitate to recommend them.; I work for a boutique leadership and communication consulting firm. As part of our service offerings, we provide clients a private and secure performance / developmental review site where employees are able to provide one another feedback on a regular cadence. We initially used an internal site, but as the scale of our projects and clients began to increase, we knew we needed to increase the sophistication of our site. That's where AllianceTek came in. Working together hand-in-hand, we developed a site tailored to the needs of our clients. Since development of the site, we've had clients ask for increased personalization and customization, and AllianceTek has been able to help us develop these in an expedient and efficient manner. Another bonus is that even after several years of working together, we've had the same points of contact throughout. This has been an invaluable part of us working together so well. After the past few years of working together, I couldn't recommend AllianceTek highly enough.; ; AllianceTek has delivered outstanding products and services which has helped Strategas achieve outstanding recognition from our financial services clients. Beyond those technical achievements, what sets this team apart from the crowd is the rapid responsiveness to my requests, be it a production problem, coding change, or business challenge; that kind of responsiveness is an exceptional work ethic not frequently seen in our industry and highly valued by my firm. I can always count upon this team to respond in kind with their best efforts.; ; "

Glad to see the integration with Travis CI due to which we could optimally use this tool with our CI CD pipelines directly. We were able to effectively run TestNG and Selenium tests using their documentation and as an added advantage their support team is quick and helpful.; The industry we function (e-commerce) has a broad category of audience. We need to make sure our website is accessible to everyone irrespective of the browser / operating system they use. Ofcourse, responsive web design check is a major bullet point over our testing checklist as well. As a B2C, it's crucial for us to stay ahead of the customers and we wanted a solution which could help us ensure our changes would work seamlessly when shipped to the Production. LambdaTest made a great fit here when considered the latest browsers on the product, ability to test local pages along with a complimentary access to LT browser which is an absolute delight for our developers and testers. It helps us save a considerable effort on responsive testing plus the native developer tools allow us to dig deep into any UI mismatch! Also As mentioned we could achieve wider test coverage in time by running multiple combinations of browsers in parallel with LambdaTest automation suite. Our director to purchase the subscription was due to their affordable pricing for the parallel tests and the communication from the support team!; Running tests serially can be a good option when your product is at an early stage. But as we scaled the product, we needed a tool to reduce test time execution and pace up our test cycles. LambdaTest simplified the Selenium testing experience for us with their cloud based platform which allowed us to execute our test cases in parallel on hundreds of browsers. We could easily automate the test cases, get the sessions recorded and share the test reports across the team for assessment using Asana integration. We even leverage the integration with CircleCI to run automated tests on LambdaTest through our pipeline. The CircleCI Orb is handy for testing our privately hosted application.It’s good to see now that using LambdaTest we could run multiple tests on multiple VM’s, saving us hours of testing time and maintenance cost of local infrastructure. Personally, one thing that LambdaTest does very well is continuing to provide tutorials for testing, so that we stay up to speed and are even able to learn new things.I definitely saw myself applying a lot of the new concepts that I learned from their blogs.; As technology advances, enterprises are switching from manual testing to Selenium Test Automation. But one area most enterprises are still struggling is with the scalability of running several tests in parallel. LambdaTest has been a boon for us when it comes to Selenium automation. With a Selenium Grid based on the cloud, we don't need to stress about setting up and maintaining infrastructure anymore. We can run hundreds of tests in parallel on 2000+ browsers and OS versions running on real machines. LambdaTest really helped us in reducing our web testing cost and at the same time scale it as and when required.To leverage on marketing campaigns, we needed to ensure all our deliverables render seamlessly on different mobile and desktop browsers our users use to view them from across the world. The geolocation testing functionality helped us set the location and test our website over various locations. At LambdaTest, we can now run geolocation testing to test our website across 40+ countries. The pricing plan is pretty simple and easy to grasp, with no hidden costs at all.; We needed a testing tool that was scalable enough to cover all the browsers and OS as per our clients requirement and at the same time integrate well into our workflow. Lambdatest provided us with the necessary features to meet our browser compatibility testing requirements. Without any hassle of configuring, installing or maintaining the virtual machines, we are able to launch local browser tests instantly. The best part is, Lambdatest also helps us run our Selenium based automated tests on its cloud infra - that too without burning a hole in our pocket. They offer extensive mobile and desktop browsers, thereby increasing our test coverage to maximum.; We serve a variety of clients across industries, thus we need to make sure our website is accessible from every desktop, mobile browser combination they use. Responsive web design is an integral part of our testing process. As a B2B, you want to make sure that your services are always a step ahead of your customers. And to achieve that, it's important to have a tool that keeps your code and web designing process in sync with the Production.LambdaTest's variety of browsers and local testing capabilities made it a perfect fit for our requirements. Additionally we got free access to LT Browser which is absolutely loved by our developers. We are now in a better position while tackling misbehaving websites with the help of it’s inbuilt dev tools. The best part is that LambdaTest offers an automated parallel testing that helped us achieve faster and wider test coverage over multiple browsers. Its affordable price and fast technical support made the purchase decision very easy for the team. And yes I absolutely love their support staff. They are truly available for 24*7.; While we develop our web applications, our top concern was to verify the unintentional changes to the application's visuals. We need to make sure that changing one component doesn't break the styling of another component. LambdaTest's Smart testing helped us to identify visual regression bugs for every new build. We could capture our website screenshots belonging to different environments i.e stage and production & upload them on the LambdaTest Visual Testing platform. We were able to discover visual deviations with pixel to pixel comparison by capturing screenshots, comparing them against the baseline image, and highlighting visual changes. The slider mode is very helpful to compare the visual discrepancies between the two images by toggling them. Overall, Smart testing helped us perform reliable visual testing at scale and eliminated the risk of delivering visual bugs."
Serverspace,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2019,"First of all I would like to thank Serverspace for this great platform! Out of other VPS services, this is my favorite, it offers me the flexibility to enhance my skills as a Full-Stack Developer as well as a server administrator. Well out of frustrations from other VPS services, since they have a lot of hassle to work on, this platform enabled me to easily pick my choice, add new memory capability just by a few clicks. I observed the great UI/UX of this platform, and I am planning to use this forever until this platform is still working.; I tried many cloud server providers like AWS, Azure, Google cloud and more but they didn't satisfy my needs but when I tried Serverspace I was shocked because of their server prices, for a startup that will be the best option, I saw that the price is low but the service is best as expensive, I am fully satisfied with this. I recommend Serverspace for startups once a time you see, a cybercriminal attacked my server in serverspace but... the company has reported me on time, so I saved my server from further attacks, Serverspace saved a lot of time and money.; What I like about this company is the many options offered to us customers since I'm a Windows/Linux User and most of my needs rely on multi-OS systems. That's why I run 4 servers with ServerSpace. Their Windows Machines are as good as you can imagine, they offer all the alternatives I need, and I also run servers with CentOS. With Serverspace, I can cover all my needs for my business, and the best part is I also have different options on the payment side. They only charge me for the current use and not a whole monthly amount in advance, and I can cancel any server I ordered at any second. Also, their support tickets get answered right away. It's pretty good. What I think they could do better is improve their automatic system detecting payments with Ever. Every time I pay with Ever, I have to send a support ticket with transaction ID and all info about the payment to add funds. I get a reply the same day, but I'd rather not have to notify it. I'm very happy with this service, and I'll; I tried six to seven cloud services before I settled with Serverspace. I am glad that I found it. All I need was a reliable, scalable, economical, and user-friendly server for my data crunching and web application. First, their pricing is way attractive. The bigger sites may start with some low teaser rates or even free credits, but their prices go up exponentially with more CPU and memory. Serverspace's pricing remains very reasonable. Granted they don't offer super big servers, I don't need them either. The other thing I like is that they charge significantly less when you turn off the server while other sites charge you the same. I like their simple offers; simple servers that let me build my own environments. The plethora of bells and whistles elsewhere turn me off. Their servers are generally reliable except they failed to turn on a couple of times. But they fixed it promptly and were responsive through the process. Their clean and intuitive web UI is helpful.; I work most of the time but I also trade forex to make some extra money. Since I am not always at home, I had to get an expert advisor for my trades and that was when I started looking for a reliable VPS service. I have been using Serverspace VPS for less than a year now and I can say it has been a peaceful experience in the sense that I never had to worry about shutting down of the server. It's very pocket-friendly and I like that I can pay daily as I use it. What I enjoy most is the option to shutdown a server without deleting or destroying it completely, that way I can restart the server when I need it and continue using it. Like I said, you only get charged for what you use. For a little fee, you also have the option to increase the size or speed of a VPS server if your work becomes bigger without having to get a new server. I can only hope to get more than 50 Mbps speed for the fixed plan as it takes more time to work when everything is so slow.; I have been using Serverspace for about 6 months now. System performance is good. I have never used a VPS before, so I need some help getting up and running. Support always answers back thru a support ticket, although you may have to wait up to 6 hours sometimes, the support is good. Their pricing has been great, and I plan to stay with the service.; Before I decided to use their servers to host our services, I checked out and tried many alternatives. Some time ago I found Serverspace at some offers comparer and I decided to give it a try and I'm really satisfied. There are no problems with servers which I met using servers from others. So at the moment, I think I will use Serverspace servers for my other projects and initiatives.; I like Serverspace! The relation between the purchase price and the performance is perfect. I like dealing with you because of the cheap prices and high performance. Also, the support team is fast, I always get my tickets resolved as fast as possible. The deployment of services is also fast. In general, I do have a good experience and would like to build a long-term relationship.; The uptime and the speed of the service are fantastic. The quality of support is second to none. Every time I need help, I get a very personalized answer and they always go the extra mile to solve my problem. I have tried many competitors in the past but none of them come close to the quality of service I am getting in Serverspace."

After interviewing multiple (8) companies, I selected Alliancetek because they were experienced, offered end to end solutions beyond a standard mobile app firm, and their price point was below competing firms.Alliancetek delivered on all promises with great professionalism. We had to pivot several times in the course of the project and each hurdle was handled without a hitch. My “team” consisted of 3 Alliancetek employees (1 project manager, 1 iOS developer, 1 Android developer) who I spoke with weekly through Microsoft Team meetings.

Since development of the site, we've had clients ask for increased personalization and customization, and AllianceTek has been able to help us develop these in an expedient and efficient manner.

LambdaTest,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2017,"Being a developer, responsive testing comes as a part of the package, every time I develop a webpage. I have been relying over LambdaTest for responsive testing. They have a feature which allows me to capture full page screenshots of my webpages in scores of different devices. I could even capture web pages that are locally hosted. And now, they have come up with a browser that lets me not only capture screenshots but interact with my websites in 25+ different devices, in a side by side view. That allows me to test my website responsiveness on a bunch of devices in a live-interactive manner. I must admit I am highly impressed by the LT browser and I am a tough guy to impress.; We use LambdaTest across our development & testing team. Our developers always perform cross browser tests on their local pages across different browsers and their versions before sending them to the testers. The integrations with 3rd party tools make it more useful. It provides a full development environment that looks very close to the real thing.Before we started using LambdaTest, we're limited to the browsers and their versions that are available on our desktops and laptops. But now with LambdaTest, we are using Selenium grid of 2000+ browsers and their versions available on the platform.If you want a solution to replace testing infrastructure that is hard to main and look after, LambdaTest is the best solution according to us.; Have been using Lambdatest for around 1 year now, and could say that it’s a useful testing tool for our team. Offering great combinations of browsers and operating systems for you to test on and most importantly there are many types of additional logs that come with each test which helps in debugging.. Glad to see the integration with Travis CI due to which we could optimally use this tool with our CI CD pipelines directly. We were able to effectively run TestNG and Selenium tests using their documentation and as an added advantage their support team is quick and helpful.; The industry we function (e-commerce) has a broad category of audience. We need to make sure our website is accessible to everyone irrespective of the browser / operating system they use. Ofcourse, responsive web design check is a major bullet point over our testing checklist as well. As a B2C, it's crucial for us to stay ahead of the customers and we wanted a solution which could help us ensure our changes would work seamlessly when shipped to the Production. LambdaTest made a great fit here when considered the latest browsers on the product, ability to test local pages along with a complimentary access to LT browser which is an absolute delight for our developers and testers. It helps us save a considerable effort on responsive testing plus the native developer tools allow us to dig deep into any UI mismatch! Also As mentioned we could achieve wider test coverage in time by running multiple combinations of browsers in parallel with LambdaTest automation suite. Our director to purchase the subscription was due to their affordable pricing for the parallel tests and the communication from the support team!; Running tests serially can be a good option when your product is at an early stage. But as we scaled the product, we needed a tool to reduce test time execution and pace up our test cycles. LambdaTest simplified the Selenium testing experience for us with their cloud based platform which allowed us to execute our test cases in parallel on hundreds of browsers. We could easily automate the test cases, get the sessions recorded and share the test reports across the team for assessment using Asana integration. We even leverage the integration with CircleCI to run automated tests on LambdaTest through our pipeline. The CircleCI Orb is handy for testing our privately hosted application.It’s good to see now that using LambdaTest we could run multiple tests on multiple VM’s, saving us hours of testing time and maintenance cost of local infrastructure. Personally, one thing that LambdaTest does very well is continuing to provide tutorials for testing, so that we stay up to speed and are even able to learn new things.I definitely saw myself applying a lot of the new concepts that I learned from their blogs.; As technology advances, enterprises are switching from manual testing to Selenium Test Automation. But one area most enterprises are still struggling is with the scalability of running several tests in parallel. LambdaTest has been a boon for us when it comes to Selenium automation. With a Selenium Grid based on the cloud, we don't need to stress about setting up and maintaining infrastructure anymore. We can run hundreds of tests in parallel on 2000+ browsers and OS versions running on real machines. LambdaTest really helped us in reducing our web testing cost and at the same time scale it as and when required.To leverage on marketing campaigns, we needed to ensure all our deliverables render seamlessly on different mobile and desktop browsers our users use to view them from across the world. The geolocation testing functionality helped us set the location and test our website over various locations. At LambdaTest, we can now run geolocation testing to test our website across 40+ countries. The pricing plan is pretty simple and easy to grasp, with no hidden costs at all.; We needed a testing tool that was scalable enough to cover all the browsers and OS as per our clients requirement and at the same time integrate well into our workflow. Lambdatest provided us with the necessary features to meet our browser compatibility testing requirements. Without any hassle of configuring, installing or maintaining the virtual machines, we are able to launch local browser tests instantly. The best part is, Lambdatest also helps us run our Selenium based automated tests on its cloud infra - that too without burning a hole in our pocket. They offer extensive mobile and desktop browsers, thereby increasing our test coverage to maximum.; We serve a variety of clients across industries, thus we need to make sure our website is accessible from every desktop, mobile browser combination they use. Responsive web design is an integral part of our testing process. As a B2B, you want to make sure that your services are always a step ahead of your customers. And to achieve that, it's important to have a tool that keeps your code and web designing process in sync with the Production.LambdaTest's variety of browsers and local testing capabilities made it a perfect fit for our requirements. Additionally we got free access to LT Browser which is absolutely loved by our developers. We are now in a better position while tackling misbehaving websites with the help of it’s inbuilt dev tools. The best part is that LambdaTest offers an automated parallel testing that helped us achieve faster and wider test coverage over multiple browsers. Its affordable price and fast technical support made the purchase decision very easy for the team. And yes I absolutely love their support staff. They are truly available for 24*7.; While we develop our web applications, our top concern was to verify the unintentional changes to the application's visuals. We need to make sure that changing one component doesn't break the styling of another component. LambdaTest's Smart testing helped us to identify visual regression bugs for every new build. We could capture our website screenshots belonging to different environments i.e stage and production & upload them on the LambdaTest Visual Testing platform. We were able to discover visual deviations with pixel to pixel comparison by capturing screenshots, comparing them against the baseline image, and highlighting visual changes. The slider mode is very helpful to compare the visual discrepancies between the two images by toggling them. Overall, Smart testing helped us perform reliable visual testing at scale and eliminated the risk of delivering visual bugs."
Serverspace,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2019,"First of all I would like to thank Serverspace for this great platform! Out of other VPS services, this is my favorite, it offers me the flexibility to enhance my skills as a Full-Stack Developer as well as a server administrator. Well out of frustrations from other VPS services, since they have a lot of hassle to work on, this platform enabled me to easily pick my choice, add new memory capability just by a few clicks. I observed the great UI/UX of this platform, and I am planning to use this forever until this platform is still working.; I tried many cloud server providers like AWS, Azure, Google cloud and more but they didn't satisfy my needs but when I tried Serverspace I was shocked because of their server prices, for a startup that will be the best option, I saw that the price is low but the service is best as expensive, I am fully satisfied with this. I recommend Serverspace for startups once a time you see, a cybercriminal attacked my server in serverspace but... the company has reported me on time, so I saved my server from further attacks, Serverspace saved a lot of time and money.; What I like about this company is the many options offered to us customers since I'm a Windows/Linux User and most of my needs rely on multi-OS systems. That's why I run 4 servers with ServerSpace. Their Windows Machines are as good as you can imagine, they offer all the alternatives I need, and I also run servers with CentOS. With Serverspace, I can cover all my needs for my business, and the best part is I also have different options on the payment side. They only charge me for the current use and not a whole monthly amount in advance, and I can cancel any server I ordered at any second. Also, their support tickets get answered right away. It's pretty good. What I think they could do better is improve their automatic system detecting payments with Ever. Every time I pay with Ever, I have to send a support ticket with transaction ID and all info about the payment to add funds. I get a reply the same day, but I'd rather not have to notify it. I'm very happy with this service, and I'll; I tried six to seven cloud services before I settled with Serverspace. I am glad that I found it. All I need was a reliable, scalable, economical, and user-friendly server for my data crunching and web application. First, their pricing is way attractive. The bigger sites may start with some low teaser rates or even free credits, but their prices go up exponentially with more CPU and memory. Serverspace's pricing remains very reasonable. Granted they don't offer super big servers, I don't need them either. The other thing I like is that they charge significantly less when you turn off the server while other sites charge you the same. I like their simple offers; simple servers that let me build my own environments. The plethora of bells and whistles elsewhere turn me off. Their servers are generally reliable except they failed to turn on a couple of times. But they fixed it promptly and were responsive through the process. Their clean and intuitive web UI is helpful.; I work most of the time but I also trade forex to make some extra money. Since I am not always at home, I had to get an expert advisor for my trades and that was when I started looking for a reliable VPS service. I have been using Serverspace VPS for less than a year now and I can say it has been a peaceful experience in the sense that I never had to worry about shutting down of the server. It's very pocket-friendly and I like that I can pay daily as I use it. What I enjoy most is the option to shutdown a server without deleting or destroying it completely, that way I can restart the server when I need it and continue using it. Like I said, you only get charged for what you use. For a little fee, you also have the option to increase the size or speed of a VPS server if your work becomes bigger without having to get a new server. I can only hope to get more than 50 Mbps speed for the fixed plan as it takes more time to work when everything is so slow.; I have been using Serverspace for about 6 months now. System performance is good. I have never used a VPS before, so I need some help getting up and running. Support always answers back thru a support ticket, although you may have to wait up to 6 hours sometimes, the support is good. Their pricing has been great, and I plan to stay with the service.; Before I decided to use their servers to host our services, I checked out and tried many alternatives. Some time ago I found Serverspace at some offers comparer and I decided to give it a try and I'm really satisfied. There are no problems with servers which I met using servers from others. So at the moment, I think I will use Serverspace servers for my other projects and initiatives.; I like Serverspace! The relation between the purchase price and the performance is perfect. I like dealing with you because of the cheap prices and high performance. Also, the support team is fast, I always get my tickets resolved as fast as possible. The deployment of services is also fast. In general, I do have a good experience and would like to build a long-term relationship.; The uptime and the speed of the service are fantastic. The quality of support is second to none. Every time I need help, I get a very personalized answer and they always go the extra mile to solve my problem. I have tried many competitors in the past but none of them come close to the quality of service I am getting in Serverspace."

The app is a social media platform for investing with back end analytics similar to Twitter. The development required integration with a high end data provider and a separate charting platform. After interviewing multiple (8) companies, I selected Alliancetek because they were experienced, offered end to end solutions beyond a standard mobile app firm, and their price point was below competing firms.Alliancetek delivered on all promises with great professionalism. We had to pivot several times in the course of the project and each hurdle was handled without a hitch. My “team” consisted of 3 Alliancetek employees (1 project manager, 1 iOS developer, 1 Android developer) who I spoke with weekly through Microsoft Team meetings. There were additional back end developers who worked on the project. I had an outstanding experience and give Alliancetek my highest recommendation.; My company was close to the launch date for a software platform that allows aspiring US college athletes to get recruited. It was a complex system involving many different elements, user types and features. With our primary in-house developer, we were running very late on our development schedule. We had a few months left to finish off the system before our customers began to use it. We brought AllianceTek on and they helped us get over the line with their amazing, responsive and high quality work. Without their tremendous work, we would not have been able to get over the line and give our customers a product that would be helpful to them. AllianceTek were honestly a game changer, and I could not imagine being where we are today as a company without their heavy and continued involvement.; The project has moved extremely smooth. The communication, the Dev team, I mean all of you guys over at Alliance Tech have just blown away my expectations and I can't thank you guys enough for helping me bring this idea into a reality. This is going to, not just revolutionise the industry, but revolutionise sales training in general. it's going to be able to present different scenarios, to the training platform getting feedback and uploading their videos to train to where we can train hundreds of people at the same time. I mean guys, this software that you guys have helped bring to life is truly going to change the industry.; Sokolis Group has been working with AllianceTek for almost a decade. We partnered with them to design and build a proprietary application that is critical to our business for analyzing and reporting our clients' fuel transaction data. Over the years, we have continued to work with AllianceTek to develop new features which helped make our business more efficient and our reporting to clients more insightful. In addition, AllianceTek provides the hosting and maintenance for this cloud-based application and we trust them to handle this important responsibility. They are a valued partner to our business and I would not hesitate to recommend them.; I work for a boutique leadership and communication consulting firm. As part of our service offerings, we provide clients a private and secure performance / developmental review site where employees are able to provide one another feedback on a regular cadence. We initially used an internal site, but as the scale of our projects and clients began to increase, we knew we needed to increase the sophistication of our site. That's where AllianceTek came in. Working together hand-in-hand, we developed a site tailored to the needs of our clients. Since development of the site, we've had clients ask for increased personalization and customization, and AllianceTek has been able to help us develop these in an expedient and efficient manner. Another bonus is that even after several years of working together, we've had the same points of contact throughout. This has been an invaluable part of us working together so well. After the past few years of working together, I couldn't recommend AllianceTek highly enough.; ; AllianceTek has delivered outstanding products and services which has helped Strategas achieve outstanding recognition from our financial services clients. Beyond those technical achievements, what sets this team apart from the crowd is the rapid responsiveness to my requests, be it a production problem, coding change, or business challenge; that kind of responsiveness is an exceptional work ethic not frequently seen in our industry and highly valued by my firm. I can always count upon this team to respond in kind with their best efforts.; ; "

This thing forced me to share my experience over here , I believe that Perfectiongeeks is going to be the best IT company in the coming years. Highly recommendable as they proved they are not only behind the money, and will always be stick on their words. Thank You PerfectionGeeks Technologies for your Wonderful support.; I was looking for the mobile & web application company for my Blockchain project. I pitched to Perfectiongeeks Technologies. And after the 2nd call the director (Shrey Bhardwaj) him self call me. And make me understand the whole process. He make me understand how and what all things can bee keep under my application. Their head office is in India I was scared to pay to offshore company with advance. But they way Mr. Shrey Bhardwaj deal with me. He openly asked me that they will work on the application and after the approval on the Complete designs of mobile application only then I need to pay them. I mean for approximately 30 days. The entire team work without the advance money. And on the 1st advance payment which is already 30 days from the start the back-end team already completed the 50% of the entire project.

< $25/hr ",2015,"I am honored and posting a very honest and sincere good word for Five Exceptions Software Solutions. They have done a fantastic job to my company website and created a full blown Mobile App for us. They have been supporting us for the last two and half years. We are very satisfied with their work ethics and support. They are always available and respond promptly to all our needs. All tasks move through progressive stages until they are completed. Communication and correspondences are done on a very easy to follow portal and it is always clear and straight forward. Their charges and rates are quite reasonable. I must be one of their satisfied customers and will not have any reservation referring their service anyone.Keep up the good job and thank you.Rashid Hassan; I had the opportunity to involve Five Exceptions Software Solution (FESS) in the implementation of a new Mobile App for iOS and Android. The App required strong experience in the geo-positioning of cars and real time speed-position-distance calculation. We started with a very detailed functional specification from which FESS was able to quickly understand the requirements and to derive technical specs autonomously. Despite some initial troubles on optimizing the algorithm for distance, speed and average speed calculation, FESS went definitely extra miles on code refinement and bug resolution and actively contributed to the submission of the App to Apple Store and Google Play. The App was completed on time and budget for a major car event and succeeded to provide the expected services despite it was installed on several untested devices and with no significant issues. FESS is still involved in the Phase 2 of the implementation project which includes the deployment of new features and enhancements. Definitely appreciated the skill-set and the rational and calm approach to problem solving of their Project Lead Roshan Parmar.; ; Jaya and her team at Five Exceptions delivered a complex project for us, which combined content from 3 different Wordpress websites, and seamlessly integrated them into one. They also made improvements to our website security and design, and implemented SEO across the site also. All this was delivered on time, for a reasonable price, and in a very friendly, polite and professional manner. We at CALP would recommend them highly.; I ask them to create a server in Amazon Web Service (AWS), and they did an excelent job. They are very profesional, very kind, nice to work with, always wanted to help. Completelly recommended.; Five Exceptions was hired to develop a Shopify site for a key client. They put together a skilled team who were able to execute on the design and were responsive to questions.; I have worked with many free lancers or overseas companies but the level of commitment for these guys has always been a dream.

LambdaTest,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2017,"Being a developer, responsive testing comes as a part of the package, every time I develop a webpage. I have been relying over LambdaTest for responsive testing. They have a feature which allows me to capture full page screenshots of my webpages in scores of different devices. I could even capture web pages that are locally hosted. And now, they have come up with a browser that lets me not only capture screenshots but interact with my websites in 25+ different devices, in a side by side view. That allows me to test my website responsiveness on a bunch of devices in a live-interactive manner. I must admit I am highly impressed by the LT browser and I am a tough guy to impress.; We use LambdaTest across our development & testing team. Our developers always perform cross browser tests on their local pages across different browsers and their versions before sending them to the testers. The integrations with 3rd party tools make it more useful. It provides a full development environment that looks very close to the real thing.Before we started using LambdaTest, we're limited to the browsers and their versions that are available on our desktops and laptops. But now with LambdaTest, we are using Selenium grid of 2000+ browsers and their versions available on the platform.If you want a solution to replace testing infrastructure that is hard to main and look after, LambdaTest is the best solution according to us.; Have been using Lambdatest for around 1 year now, and could say that it’s a useful testing tool for our team. Offering great combinations of browsers and operating systems for you to test on and most importantly there are many types of additional logs that come with each test which helps in debugging.. Glad to see the integration with Travis CI due to which we could optimally use this tool with our CI CD pipelines directly. We were able to effectively run TestNG and Selenium tests using their documentation and as an added advantage their support team is quick and helpful.; The industry we function (e-commerce) has a broad category of audience. We need to make sure our website is accessible to everyone irrespective of the browser / operating system they use. Ofcourse, responsive web design check is a major bullet point over our testing checklist as well. As a B2C, it's crucial for us to stay ahead of the customers and we wanted a solution which could help us ensure our changes would work seamlessly when shipped to the Production. LambdaTest made a great fit here when considered the latest browsers on the product, ability to test local pages along with a complimentary access to LT browser which is an absolute delight for our developers and testers. It helps us save a considerable effort on responsive testing plus the native developer tools allow us to dig deep into any UI mismatch! Also As mentioned we could achieve wider test coverage in time by running multiple combinations of browsers in parallel with LambdaTest automation suite. Our director to purchase the subscription was due to their affordable pricing for the parallel tests and the communication from the support team!; Running tests serially can be a good option when your product is at an early stage. But as we scaled the product, we needed a tool to reduce test time execution and pace up our test cycles. LambdaTest simplified the Selenium testing experience for us with their cloud based platform which allowed us to execute our test cases in parallel on hundreds of browsers. We could easily automate the test cases, get the sessions recorded and share the test reports across the team for assessment using Asana integration. We even leverage the integration with CircleCI to run automated tests on LambdaTest through our pipeline. The CircleCI Orb is handy for testing our privately hosted application.It’s good to see now that using LambdaTest we could run multiple tests on multiple VM’s, saving us hours of testing time and maintenance cost of local infrastructure. Personally, one thing that LambdaTest does very well is continuing to provide tutorials for testing, so that we stay up to speed and are even able to learn new things.I definitely saw myself applying a lot of the new concepts that I learned from their blogs.; As technology advances, enterprises are switching from manual testing to Selenium Test Automation. But one area most enterprises are still struggling is with the scalability of running several tests in parallel. LambdaTest has been a boon for us when it comes to Selenium automation. With a Selenium Grid based on the cloud, we don't need to stress about setting up and maintaining infrastructure anymore. We can run hundreds of tests in parallel on 2000+ browsers and OS versions running on real machines. LambdaTest really helped us in reducing our web testing cost and at the same time scale it as and when required.To leverage on marketing campaigns, we needed to ensure all our deliverables render seamlessly on different mobile and desktop browsers our users use to view them from across the world. The geolocation testing functionality helped us set the location and test our website over various locations. At LambdaTest, we can now run geolocation testing to test our website across 40+ countries. The pricing plan is pretty simple and easy to grasp, with no hidden costs at all.; We needed a testing tool that was scalable enough to cover all the browsers and OS as per our clients requirement and at the same time integrate well into our workflow. Lambdatest provided us with the necessary features to meet our browser compatibility testing requirements. Without any hassle of configuring, installing or maintaining the virtual machines, we are able to launch local browser tests instantly. The best part is, Lambdatest also helps us run our Selenium based automated tests on its cloud infra - that too without burning a hole in our pocket. They offer extensive mobile and desktop browsers, thereby increasing our test coverage to maximum.; We serve a variety of clients across industries, thus we need to make sure our website is accessible from every desktop, mobile browser combination they use. Responsive web design is an integral part of our testing process. As a B2B, you want to make sure that your services are always a step ahead of your customers. And to achieve that, it's important to have a tool that keeps your code and web designing process in sync with the Production.LambdaTest's variety of browsers and local testing capabilities made it a perfect fit for our requirements. Additionally we got free access to LT Browser which is absolutely loved by our developers. We are now in a better position while tackling misbehaving websites with the help of it’s inbuilt dev tools. The best part is that LambdaTest offers an automated parallel testing that helped us achieve faster and wider test coverage over multiple browsers. Its affordable price and fast technical support made the purchase decision very easy for the team. And yes I absolutely love their support staff. They are truly available for 24*7.; While we develop our web applications, our top concern was to verify the unintentional changes to the application's visuals. We need to make sure that changing one component doesn't break the styling of another component. LambdaTest's Smart testing helped us to identify visual regression bugs for every new build. We could capture our website screenshots belonging to different environments i.e stage and production & upload them on the LambdaTest Visual Testing platform. We were able to discover visual deviations with pixel to pixel comparison by capturing screenshots, comparing them against the baseline image, and highlighting visual changes. The slider mode is very helpful to compare the visual discrepancies between the two images by toggling them. Overall, Smart testing helped us perform reliable visual testing at scale and eliminated the risk of delivering visual bugs."
Serverspace,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2019,"First of all I would like to thank Serverspace for this great platform! Out of other VPS services, this is my favorite, it offers me the flexibility to enhance my skills as a Full-Stack Developer as well as a server administrator. Well out of frustrations from other VPS services, since they have a lot of hassle to work on, this platform enabled me to easily pick my choice, add new memory capability just by a few clicks. I observed the great UI/UX of this platform, and I am planning to use this forever until this platform is still working.; I tried many cloud server providers like AWS, Azure, Google cloud and more but they didn't satisfy my needs but when I tried Serverspace I was shocked because of their server prices, for a startup that will be the best option, I saw that the price is low but the service is best as expensive, I am fully satisfied with this. I recommend Serverspace for startups once a time you see, a cybercriminal attacked my server in serverspace but... the company has reported me on time, so I saved my server from further attacks, Serverspace saved a lot of time and money.; What I like about this company is the many options offered to us customers since I'm a Windows/Linux User and most of my needs rely on multi-OS systems. That's why I run 4 servers with ServerSpace. Their Windows Machines are as good as you can imagine, they offer all the alternatives I need, and I also run servers with CentOS. With Serverspace, I can cover all my needs for my business, and the best part is I also have different options on the payment side. They only charge me for the current use and not a whole monthly amount in advance, and I can cancel any server I ordered at any second. Also, their support tickets get answered right away. It's pretty good. What I think they could do better is improve their automatic system detecting payments with Ever. Every time I pay with Ever, I have to send a support ticket with transaction ID and all info about the payment to add funds. I get a reply the same day, but I'd rather not have to notify it. I'm very happy with this service, and I'll; I tried six to seven cloud services before I settled with Serverspace. I am glad that I found it. All I need was a reliable, scalable, economical, and user-friendly server for my data crunching and web application. First, their pricing is way attractive. The bigger sites may start with some low teaser rates or even free credits, but their prices go up exponentially with more CPU and memory. Serverspace's pricing remains very reasonable. Granted they don't offer super big servers, I don't need them either. The other thing I like is that they charge significantly less when you turn off the server while other sites charge you the same. I like their simple offers; simple servers that let me build my own environments. The plethora of bells and whistles elsewhere turn me off. Their servers are generally reliable except they failed to turn on a couple of times. But they fixed it promptly and were responsive through the process. Their clean and intuitive web UI is helpful.; I work most of the time but I also trade forex to make some extra money. Since I am not always at home, I had to get an expert advisor for my trades and that was when I started looking for a reliable VPS service. I have been using Serverspace VPS for less than a year now and I can say it has been a peaceful experience in the sense that I never had to worry about shutting down of the server. It's very pocket-friendly and I like that I can pay daily as I use it. What I enjoy most is the option to shutdown a server without deleting or destroying it completely, that way I can restart the server when I need it and continue using it. Like I said, you only get charged for what you use. For a little fee, you also have the option to increase the size or speed of a VPS server if your work becomes bigger without having to get a new server. I can only hope to get more than 50 Mbps speed for the fixed plan as it takes more time to work when everything is so slow.; I have been using Serverspace for about 6 months now. System performance is good. I have never used a VPS before, so I need some help getting up and running. Support always answers back thru a support ticket, although you may have to wait up to 6 hours sometimes, the support is good. Their pricing has been great, and I plan to stay with the service.; Before I decided to use their servers to host our services, I checked out and tried many alternatives. Some time ago I found Serverspace at some offers comparer and I decided to give it a try and I'm really satisfied. There are no problems with servers which I met using servers from others. So at the moment, I think I will use Serverspace servers for my other projects and initiatives.; I like Serverspace! The relation between the purchase price and the performance is perfect. I like dealing with you because of the cheap prices and high performance. Also, the support team is fast, I always get my tickets resolved as fast as possible. The deployment of services is also fast. In general, I do have a good experience and would like to build a long-term relationship.; The uptime and the speed of the service are fantastic. The quality of support is second to none. Every time I need help, I get a very personalized answer and they always go the extra mile to solve my problem. I have tried many competitors in the past but none of them come close to the quality of service I am getting in Serverspace."

After interviewing multiple (8) companies, I selected Alliancetek because they were experienced, offered end to end solutions beyond a standard mobile app firm, and their price point was below competing firms.Alliancetek delivered on all promises with great professionalism. We had to pivot several times in the course of the project and each hurdle was handled without a hitch.

The communication, the Dev team, I mean all of you guys over at Alliance Tech have just blown away my expectations and I can't thank you guys enough for helping me bring this idea into a reality. This is going to, not just revolutionise the industry, but revolutionise sales training in general. it's going to be able to present different scenarios, to the training platform getting feedback and uploading their videos to train to where we can train hundreds of people at the same time. I mean guys, this software that you guys have helped bring to life is truly going to change the industry.; Sokolis Group has been working with AllianceTek for almost a decade. We partnered with them to design and build a proprietary application that is critical to our business for analyzing and reporting our clients' fuel transaction data. Over the years, we have continued to work with AllianceTek to develop new features which helped make our business more efficient and our reporting to clients more insightful. In addition, AllianceTek provides the hosting and maintenance for this cloud-based application and we trust them to handle this important responsibility. They are a valued partner to our business and I would not hesitate to recommend them.; I work for a boutique leadership and communication consulting firm. As part of our service offerings, we provide clients a private and secure performance / developmental review site where employees are able to provide one another feedback on a regular cadence. We initially used an internal site, but as the scale of our projects and clients began to increase, we knew we needed to increase the sophistication of our site. That's where AllianceTek came in. Working together hand-in-hand, we developed a site tailored to the needs of our clients. Since development of the site, we've had clients ask for increased personalization and customization, and AllianceTek has been able to help us develop these in an expedient and efficient manner. Another bonus is that even after several years of working together, we've had the same points of contact throughout. This has been an invaluable part of us working together so well. After the past few years of working together, I couldn't recommend AllianceTek highly enough.; ; AllianceTek has delivered outstanding products and services which has helped Strategas achieve outstanding recognition from our financial services clients. Beyond those technical achievements, what sets this team apart from the crowd is the rapid responsiveness to my requests, be it a production problem, coding change, or business challenge; that kind of responsiveness is an exceptional work ethic not frequently seen in our industry and highly valued by my firm. I can always count upon this team to respond in kind with their best efforts.; ; "

I must be one of their satisfied customers and will not have any reservation referring their service anyone.Keep up the good job and thank you.Rashid Hassan; I had the opportunity to involve Five Exceptions Software Solution (FESS) in the implementation of a new Mobile App for iOS and Android. The App required strong experience in the geo-positioning of cars and real time speed-position-distance calculation. We started with a very detailed functional specification from which FESS was able to quickly understand the requirements and to derive technical specs autonomously. Despite some initial troubles on optimizing the algorithm for distance, speed and average speed calculation, FESS went definitely extra miles on code refinement and bug resolution and actively contributed to the submission of the App to Apple Store and Google Play. The App was completed on time and budget for a major car event and succeeded to provide the expected services despite it was installed on several untested devices and with no significant issues. FESS is still involved in the Phase 2 of the implementation project which includes the deployment of new features and enhancements.

LambdaTest,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2017,"Being a developer, responsive testing comes as a part of the package, every time I develop a webpage. I have been relying over LambdaTest for responsive testing. They have a feature which allows me to capture full page screenshots of my webpages in scores of different devices. I could even capture web pages that are locally hosted. And now, they have come up with a browser that lets me not only capture screenshots but interact with my websites in 25+ different devices, in a side by side view. That allows me to test my website responsiveness on a bunch of devices in a live-interactive manner. I must admit I am highly impressed by the LT browser and I am a tough guy to impress.; We use LambdaTest across our development & testing team. Our developers always perform cross browser tests on their local pages across different browsers and their versions before sending them to the testers. The integrations with 3rd party tools make it more useful. It provides a full development environment that looks very close to the real thing.Before we started using LambdaTest, we're limited to the browsers and their versions that are available on our desktops and laptops. But now with LambdaTest, we are using Selenium grid of 2000+ browsers and their versions available on the platform.If you want a solution to replace testing infrastructure that is hard to main and look after, LambdaTest is the best solution according to us.; Have been using Lambdatest for around 1 year now, and could say that it’s a useful testing tool for our team. Offering great combinations of browsers and operating systems for you to test on and most importantly there are many types of additional logs that come with each test which helps in debugging.. Glad to see the integration with Travis CI due to which we could optimally use this tool with our CI CD pipelines directly. We were able to effectively run TestNG and Selenium tests using their documentation and as an added advantage their support team is quick and helpful.; The industry we function (e-commerce) has a broad category of audience. We need to make sure our website is accessible to everyone irrespective of the browser / operating system they use. Ofcourse, responsive web design check is a major bullet point over our testing checklist as well. As a B2C, it's crucial for us to stay ahead of the customers and we wanted a solution which could help us ensure our changes would work seamlessly when shipped to the Production. LambdaTest made a great fit here when considered the latest browsers on the product, ability to test local pages along with a complimentary access to LT browser which is an absolute delight for our developers and testers. It helps us save a considerable effort on responsive testing plus the native developer tools allow us to dig deep into any UI mismatch! Also As mentioned we could achieve wider test coverage in time by running multiple combinations of browsers in parallel with LambdaTest automation suite. Our director to purchase the subscription was due to their affordable pricing for the parallel tests and the communication from the support team!; Running tests serially can be a good option when your product is at an early stage. But as we scaled the product, we needed a tool to reduce test time execution and pace up our test cycles. LambdaTest simplified the Selenium testing experience for us with their cloud based platform which allowed us to execute our test cases in parallel on hundreds of browsers. We could easily automate the test cases, get the sessions recorded and share the test reports across the team for assessment using Asana integration. We even leverage the integration with CircleCI to run automated tests on LambdaTest through our pipeline. The CircleCI Orb is handy for testing our privately hosted application.It’s good to see now that using LambdaTest we could run multiple tests on multiple VM’s, saving us hours of testing time and maintenance cost of local infrastructure. Personally, one thing that LambdaTest does very well is continuing to provide tutorials for testing, so that we stay up to speed and are even able to learn new things.I definitely saw myself applying a lot of the new concepts that I learned from their blogs.; As technology advances, enterprises are switching from manual testing to Selenium Test Automation. But one area most enterprises are still struggling is with the scalability of running several tests in parallel. LambdaTest has been a boon for us when it comes to Selenium automation. With a Selenium Grid based on the cloud, we don't need to stress about setting up and maintaining infrastructure anymore. We can run hundreds of tests in parallel on 2000+ browsers and OS versions running on real machines. LambdaTest really helped us in reducing our web testing cost and at the same time scale it as and when required.To leverage on marketing campaigns, we needed to ensure all our deliverables render seamlessly on different mobile and desktop browsers our users use to view them from across the world. The geolocation testing functionality helped us set the location and test our website over various locations. At LambdaTest, we can now run geolocation testing to test our website across 40+ countries.

We could capture our website screenshots belonging to different environments i.e stage and production & upload them on the LambdaTest Visual Testing platform. We were able to discover visual deviations with pixel to pixel comparison by capturing screenshots, comparing them against the baseline image, and highlighting visual changes. The slider mode is very helpful to compare the visual discrepancies between the two images by toggling them. Overall, Smart testing helped us perform reliable visual testing at scale and eliminated the risk of delivering visual bugs."
Serverspace,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2019,"First of all I would like to thank Serverspace for this great platform! Out of other VPS services, this is my favorite, it offers me the flexibility to enhance my skills as a Full-Stack Developer as well as a server administrator. Well out of frustrations from other VPS services, since they have a lot of hassle to work on, this platform enabled me to easily pick my choice, add new memory capability just by a few clicks. I observed the great UI/UX of this platform, and I am planning to use this forever until this platform is still working.; I tried many cloud server providers like AWS, Azure, Google cloud and more but they didn't satisfy my needs but when I tried Serverspace I was shocked because of their server prices, for a startup that will be the best option, I saw that the price is low but the service is best as expensive, I am fully satisfied with this. I recommend Serverspace for startups once a time you see, a cybercriminal attacked my server in serverspace but... the company has reported me on time, so I saved my server from further attacks, Serverspace saved a lot of time and money.; What I like about this company is the many options offered to us customers since I'm a Windows/Linux User and most of my needs rely on multi-OS systems. That's why I run 4 servers with ServerSpace. Their Windows Machines are as good as you can imagine, they offer all the alternatives I need, and I also run servers with CentOS. With Serverspace, I can cover all my needs for my business, and the best part is I also have different options on the payment side. They only charge me for the current use and not a whole monthly amount in advance, and I can cancel any server I ordered at any second. Also, their support tickets get answered right away. It's pretty good. What I think they could do better is improve their automatic system detecting payments with Ever. Every time I pay with Ever, I have to send a support ticket with transaction ID and all info about the payment to add funds. I get a reply the same day, but I'd rather not have to notify it. I'm very happy with this service, and I'll; I tried six to seven cloud services before I settled with Serverspace. I am glad that I found it. All I need was a reliable, scalable, economical, and user-friendly server for my data crunching and web application. First, their pricing is way attractive. The bigger sites may start with some low teaser rates or even free credits, but their prices go up exponentially with more CPU and memory. Serverspace's pricing remains very reasonable. Granted they don't offer super big servers, I don't need them either. The other thing I like is that they charge significantly less when you turn off the server while other sites charge you the same. I like their simple offers; simple servers that let me build my own environments. The plethora of bells and whistles elsewhere turn me off. Their servers are generally reliable except they failed to turn on a couple of times. But they fixed it promptly and were responsive through the process. Their clean and intuitive web UI is helpful.; I work most of the time but I also trade forex to make some extra money. Since I am not always at home, I had to get an expert advisor for my trades and that was when I started looking for a reliable VPS service. I have been using Serverspace VPS for less than a year now and I can say it has been a peaceful experience in the sense that I never had to worry about shutting down of the server. It's very pocket-friendly and I like that I can pay daily as I use it. What I enjoy most is the option to shutdown a server without deleting or destroying it completely, that way I can restart the server when I need it and continue using it. Like I said, you only get charged for what you use. For a little fee, you also have the option to increase the size or speed of a VPS server if your work becomes bigger without having to get a new server. I can only hope to get more than 50 Mbps speed for the fixed plan as it takes more time to work when everything is so slow.; I have been using Serverspace for about 6 months now. System performance is good. I have never used a VPS before, so I need some help getting up and running. Support always answers back thru a support ticket, although you may have to wait up to 6 hours sometimes, the support is good. Their pricing has been great, and I plan to stay with the service.; Before I decided to use their servers to host our services, I checked out and tried many alternatives. Some time ago I found Serverspace at some offers comparer and I decided to give it a try and I'm really satisfied. There are no problems with servers which I met using servers from others. So at the moment, I think I will use Serverspace servers for my other projects and initiatives.; I like Serverspace! The relation between the purchase price and the performance is perfect. I like dealing with you because of the cheap prices and high performance. Also, the support team is fast, I always get my tickets resolved as fast as possible. The deployment of services is also fast. In general, I do have a good experience and would like to build a long-term relationship.; The uptime and the speed of the service are fantastic. The quality of support is second to none. Every time I need help, I get a very personalized answer and they always go the extra mile to solve my problem. I have tried many competitors in the past but none of them come close to the quality of service I am getting in Serverspace."

After interviewing multiple (8) companies, I selected Alliancetek because they were experienced, offered end to end solutions beyond a standard mobile app firm, and their price point was below competing firms.Alliancetek delivered on all promises with great professionalism. We had to pivot several times in the course of the project and each hurdle was handled without a hitch. My “team” consisted of 3 Alliancetek employees (1 project manager, 1 iOS developer, 1 Android developer) who I spoke with weekly through Microsoft Team meetings. There were additional back end developers who worked on the project.

Working together hand-in-hand, we developed a site tailored to the needs of our clients. Since development of the site, we've had clients ask for increased personalization and customization, and AllianceTek has been able to help us develop these in an expedient and efficient manner. Another bonus is that even after several years of working together, we've had the same points of contact throughout. This has been an invaluable part of us working together so well. After the past few years of working together, I couldn't recommend AllianceTek highly enough.; ; AllianceTek has delivered outstanding products and services which has helped Strategas achieve outstanding recognition from our financial services clients.

From start to finish my interaction with the team at IndiaNIC was professional, stress-free and I had complete trust in their ability to deliver. Their difference is :1. They don't use templates as standard, so could custom built to match my vision and created a website set-up that was completely bespoke to my needs.2. They took the time to listen to what I wanted but also brought their own ideas, experience, and creativity so that the end design was more rounded.3. They understood that I needed to see things in a visual context and have some flexibility to 'play' around with a few ideas. All of this was done face to face at their offices making the process highly personal.4. Bhavin Bhatt took the lead on my website and was exceptional - communication was constant and quick, he explained in terms I could easily understand and he made the whole process so easy it was a pleasure to work with him.Thank you for a great customer experience and fantastic end result website!; They are professional and their employees are responsible and skilled.

I must be one of their satisfied customers and will not have any reservation referring their service anyone.Keep up the good job and thank you.Rashid Hassan; I had the opportunity to involve Five Exceptions Software Solution (FESS) in the implementation of a new Mobile App for iOS and Android. The App required strong experience in the geo-positioning of cars and real time speed-position-distance calculation. We started with a very detailed functional specification from which FESS was able to quickly understand the requirements and to derive technical specs autonomously. Despite some initial troubles on optimizing the algorithm for distance, speed and average speed calculation, FESS went definitely extra miles on code refinement and bug resolution and actively contributed to the submission of the App to Apple Store and Google Play. The App was completed on time and budget for a major car event and succeeded to provide the expected services despite it was installed on several untested devices and with no significant issues. FESS is still involved in the Phase 2 of the implementation project which includes the deployment of new features and enhancements. Definitely appreciated the skill-set and the rational and calm approach to problem solving of their Project Lead Roshan Parmar.; ; Jaya and her team at Five Exceptions delivered a complex project for us, which combined content from 3 different Wordpress websites, and seamlessly integrated them into one.

LambdaTest,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2017,"Being a developer, responsive testing comes as a part of the package, every time I develop a webpage. I have been relying over LambdaTest for responsive testing. They have a feature which allows me to capture full page screenshots of my webpages in scores of different devices. I could even capture web pages that are locally hosted. And now, they have come up with a browser that lets me not only capture screenshots but interact with my websites in 25+ different devices, in a side by side view. That allows me to test my website responsiveness on a bunch of devices in a live-interactive manner. I must admit I am highly impressed by the LT browser and I am a tough guy to impress.; We use LambdaTest across our development & testing team. Our developers always perform cross browser tests on their local pages across different browsers and their versions before sending them to the testers. The integrations with 3rd party tools make it more useful. It provides a full development environment that looks very close to the real thing.Before we started using LambdaTest, we're limited to the browsers and their versions that are available on our desktops and laptops. But now with LambdaTest, we are using Selenium grid of 2000+ browsers and their versions available on the platform.If you want a solution to replace testing infrastructure that is hard to main and look after, LambdaTest is the best solution according to us.; Have been using Lambdatest for around 1 year now, and could say that it’s a useful testing tool for our team. Offering great combinations of browsers and operating systems for you to test on and most importantly there are many types of additional logs that come with each test which helps in debugging.. Glad to see the integration with Travis CI due to which we could optimally use this tool with our CI CD pipelines directly. We were able to effectively run TestNG and Selenium tests using their documentation and as an added advantage their support team is quick and helpful.; The industry we function (e-commerce) has a broad category of audience. We need to make sure our website is accessible to everyone irrespective of the browser / operating system they use. Ofcourse, responsive web design check is a major bullet point over our testing checklist as well. As a B2C, it's crucial for us to stay ahead of the customers and we wanted a solution which could help us ensure our changes would work seamlessly when shipped to the Production. LambdaTest made a great fit here when considered the latest browsers on the product, ability to test local pages along with a complimentary access to LT browser which is an absolute delight for our developers and testers. It helps us save a considerable effort on responsive testing plus the native developer tools allow us to dig deep into any UI mismatch! Also As mentioned we could achieve wider test coverage in time by running multiple combinations of browsers in parallel with LambdaTest automation suite. Our director to purchase the subscription was due to their affordable pricing for the parallel tests and the communication from the support team!; Running tests serially can be a good option when your product is at an early stage. But as we scaled the product, we needed a tool to reduce test time execution and pace up our test cycles. LambdaTest simplified the Selenium testing experience for us with their cloud based platform which allowed us to execute our test cases in parallel on hundreds of browsers. We could easily automate the test cases, get the sessions recorded and share the test reports across the team for assessment using Asana integration. We even leverage the integration with CircleCI to run automated tests on LambdaTest through our pipeline. The CircleCI Orb is handy for testing our privately hosted application.It’s good to see now that using LambdaTest we could run multiple tests on multiple VM’s, saving us hours of testing time and maintenance cost of local infrastructure. Personally, one thing that LambdaTest does very well is continuing to provide tutorials for testing, so that we stay up to speed and are even able to learn new things.I definitely saw myself applying a lot of the new concepts that I learned from their blogs.; As technology advances, enterprises are switching from manual testing to Selenium Test Automation. But one area most enterprises are still struggling is with the scalability of running several tests in parallel. LambdaTest has been a boon for us when it comes to Selenium automation. With a Selenium Grid based on the cloud, we don't need to stress about setting up and maintaining infrastructure anymore. We can run hundreds of tests in parallel on 2000+ browsers and OS versions running on real machines. LambdaTest really helped us in reducing our web testing cost and at the same time scale it as and when required.To leverage on marketing campaigns, we needed to ensure all our deliverables render seamlessly on different mobile and desktop browsers our users use to view them from across the world. The geolocation testing functionality helped us set the location and test our website over various locations. At LambdaTest, we can now run geolocation testing to test our website across 40+ countries. The pricing plan is pretty simple and easy to grasp, with no hidden costs at all.; We needed a testing tool that was scalable enough to cover all the browsers and OS as per our clients requirement and at the same time integrate well into our workflow. Lambdatest provided us with the necessary features to meet our browser compatibility testing requirements. Without any hassle of configuring, installing or maintaining the virtual machines, we are able to launch local browser tests instantly. The best part is, Lambdatest also helps us run our Selenium based automated tests on its cloud infra - that too without burning a hole in our pocket. They offer extensive mobile and desktop browsers, thereby increasing our test coverage to maximum.; We serve a variety of clients across industries, thus we need to make sure our website is accessible from every desktop, mobile browser combination they use. Responsive web design is an integral part of our testing process. As a B2B, you want to make sure that your services are always a step ahead of your customers. And to achieve that, it's important to have a tool that keeps your code and web designing process in sync with the Production.LambdaTest's variety of browsers and local testing capabilities made it a perfect fit for our requirements. Additionally we got free access to LT Browser which is absolutely loved by our developers. We are now in a better position while tackling misbehaving websites with the help of it’s inbuilt dev tools. The best part is that LambdaTest offers an automated parallel testing that helped us achieve faster and wider test coverage over multiple browsers. Its affordable price and fast technical support made the purchase decision very easy for the team. And yes I absolutely love their support staff. They are truly available for 24*7.; While we develop our web applications, our top concern was to verify the unintentional changes to the application's visuals. We need to make sure that changing one component doesn't break the styling of another component. LambdaTest's Smart testing helped us to identify visual regression bugs for every new build. We could capture our website screenshots belonging to different environments i.e stage and production & upload them on the LambdaTest Visual Testing platform. We were able to discover visual deviations with pixel to pixel comparison by capturing screenshots, comparing them against the baseline image, and highlighting visual changes. The slider mode is very helpful to compare the visual discrepancies between the two images by toggling them. Overall, Smart testing helped us perform reliable visual testing at scale and eliminated the risk of delivering visual bugs."
Serverspace,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2019,"First of all I would like to thank Serverspace for this great platform! Out of other VPS services, this is my favorite, it offers me the flexibility to enhance my skills as a Full-Stack Developer as well as a server administrator. Well out of frustrations from other VPS services, since they have a lot of hassle to work on, this platform enabled me to easily pick my choice, add new memory capability just by a few clicks. I observed the great UI/UX of this platform, and I am planning to use this forever until this platform is still working.; I tried many cloud server providers like AWS, Azure, Google cloud and more but they didn't satisfy my needs but when I tried Serverspace I was shocked because of their server prices, for a startup that will be the best option, I saw that the price is low but the service is best as expensive, I am fully satisfied with this. I recommend Serverspace for startups once a time you see, a cybercriminal attacked my server in serverspace but... the company has reported me on time, so I saved my server from further attacks, Serverspace saved a lot of time and money.; What I like about this company is the many options offered to us customers since I'm a Windows/Linux User and most of my needs rely on multi-OS systems. That's why I run 4 servers with ServerSpace. Their Windows Machines are as good as you can imagine, they offer all the alternatives I need, and I also run servers with CentOS. With Serverspace, I can cover all my needs for my business, and the best part is I also have different options on the payment side. They only charge me for the current use and not a whole monthly amount in advance, and I can cancel any server I ordered at any second. Also, their support tickets get answered right away. It's pretty good. What I think they could do better is improve their automatic system detecting payments with Ever. Every time I pay with Ever, I have to send a support ticket with transaction ID and all info about the payment to add funds. I get a reply the same day, but I'd rather not have to notify it. I'm very happy with this service, and I'll; I tried six to seven cloud services before I settled with Serverspace. I am glad that I found it. All I need was a reliable, scalable, economical, and user-friendly server for my data crunching and web application. First, their pricing is way attractive. The bigger sites may start with some low teaser rates or even free credits, but their prices go up exponentially with more CPU and memory. Serverspace's pricing remains very reasonable. Granted they don't offer super big servers, I don't need them either. The other thing I like is that they charge significantly less when you turn off the server while other sites charge you the same. I like their simple offers; simple servers that let me build my own environments. The plethora of bells and whistles elsewhere turn me off. Their servers are generally reliable except they failed to turn on a couple of times. But they fixed it promptly and were responsive through the process. Their clean and intuitive web UI is helpful.; I work most of the time but I also trade forex to make some extra money. Since I am not always at home, I had to get an expert advisor for my trades and that was when I started looking for a reliable VPS service. I have been using Serverspace VPS for less than a year now and I can say it has been a peaceful experience in the sense that I never had to worry about shutting down of the server. It's very pocket-friendly and I like that I can pay daily as I use it. What I enjoy most is the option to shutdown a server without deleting or destroying it completely, that way I can restart the server when I need it and continue using it. Like I said, you only get charged for what you use. For a little fee, you also have the option to increase the size or speed of a VPS server if your work becomes bigger without having to get a new server. I can only hope to get more than 50 Mbps speed for the fixed plan as it takes more time to work when everything is so slow.; I have been using Serverspace for about 6 months now. System performance is good. I have never used a VPS before, so I need some help getting up and running. Support always answers back thru a support ticket, although you may have to wait up to 6 hours sometimes, the support is good. Their pricing has been great, and I plan to stay with the service.; Before I decided to use their servers to host our services, I checked out and tried many alternatives. Some time ago I found Serverspace at some offers comparer and I decided to give it a try and I'm really satisfied. There are no problems with servers which I met using servers from others. So at the moment, I think I will use Serverspace servers for my other projects and initiatives.; I like Serverspace! The relation between the purchase price and the performance is perfect. I like dealing with you because of the cheap prices and high performance. Also, the support team is fast, I always get my tickets resolved as fast as possible. The deployment of services is also fast. In general, I do have a good experience and would like to build a long-term relationship.; The uptime and the speed of the service are fantastic. The quality of support is second to none. Every time I need help, I get a very personalized answer and they always go the extra mile to solve my problem. I have tried many competitors in the past but none of them come close to the quality of service I am getting in Serverspace."

$25 - $49/hr ",2004,"We are a startup fintech company and needed to develop a mobile app in iOS and Android. The app is a social media platform for investing with back end analytics similar to Twitter. The development required integration with a high end data provider and a separate charting platform. After interviewing multiple (8) companies, I selected Alliancetek because they were experienced, offered end to end solutions beyond a standard mobile app firm, and their price point was below competing firms.Alliancetek delivered on all promises with great professionalism. We had to pivot several times in the course of the project and each hurdle was handled without a hitch. My “team” consisted of 3 Alliancetek employees (1 project manager, 1 iOS developer, 1 Android developer) who I spoke with weekly through Microsoft Team meetings. There were additional back end developers who worked on the project. I had an outstanding experience and give Alliancetek my highest recommendation.; My company was close to the launch date for a software platform that allows aspiring US college athletes to get recruited. It was a complex system involving many different elements, user types and features. With our primary in-house developer, we were running very late on our development schedule. We had a few months left to finish off the system before our customers began to use it. We brought AllianceTek on and they helped us get over the line with their amazing, responsive and high quality work. Without their tremendous work, we would not have been able to get over the line and give our customers a product that would be helpful to them. AllianceTek were honestly a game changer, and I could not imagine being where we are today as a company without their heavy and continued involvement.; The project has moved extremely smooth. The communication, the Dev team, I mean all of you guys over at Alliance Tech have just blown away my expectations and I can't thank you guys enough for helping me bring this idea into a reality. This is going to, not just revolutionise the industry, but revolutionise sales training in general. it's going to be able to present different scenarios, to the training platform getting feedback and uploading their videos to train to where we can train hundreds of people at the same time. I mean guys, this software that you guys have helped bring to life is truly going to change the industry.; Sokolis Group has been working with AllianceTek for almost a decade. We partnered with them to design and build a proprietary application that is critical to our business for analyzing and reporting our clients' fuel transaction data. Over the years, we have continued to work with AllianceTek to develop new features which helped make our business more efficient and our reporting to clients more insightful. In addition, AllianceTek provides the hosting and maintenance for this cloud-based application and we trust them to handle this important responsibility. They are a valued partner to our business and I would not hesitate to recommend them.; I work for a boutique leadership and communication consulting firm. As part of our service offerings, we provide clients a private and secure performance / developmental review site where employees are able to provide one another feedback on a regular cadence. We initially used an internal site, but as the scale of our projects and clients began to increase, we knew we needed to increase the sophistication of our site. That's where AllianceTek came in. Working together hand-in-hand, we developed a site tailored to the needs of our clients. Since development of the site, we've had clients ask for increased personalization and customization, and AllianceTek has been able to help us develop these in an expedient and efficient manner. Another bonus is that even after several years of working together, we've had the same points of contact throughout. This has been an invaluable part of us working together so well. After the past few years of working together, I couldn't recommend AllianceTek highly enough.; ; AllianceTek has delivered outstanding products and services which has helped Strategas achieve outstanding recognition from our financial services clients. Beyond those technical achievements, what sets this team apart from the crowd is the rapid responsiveness to my requests, be it a production problem, coding change, or business challenge; that kind of responsiveness is an exceptional work ethic not frequently seen in our industry and highly valued by my firm. I can always count upon this team to respond in kind with their best efforts.; ; "

They have done a fantastic job to my company website and created a full blown Mobile App for us. They have been supporting us for the last two and half years. We are very satisfied with their work ethics and support. They are always available and respond promptly to all our needs. All tasks move through progressive stages until they are completed. Communication and correspondences are done on a very easy to follow portal and it is always clear and straight forward. Their charges and rates are quite reasonable. I must be one of their satisfied customers and will not have any reservation referring their service anyone.Keep up the good job and thank you.Rashid Hassan; I had the opportunity to involve Five Exceptions Software Solution (FESS) in the implementation of a new Mobile App for iOS and Android. The App required strong experience in the geo-positioning of cars and real time speed-position-distance calculation. We started with a very detailed functional specification from which FESS was able to quickly understand the requirements and to derive technical specs autonomously. Despite some initial troubles on optimizing the algorithm for distance, speed and average speed calculation, FESS went definitely extra miles on code refinement and bug resolution and actively contributed to the submission of the App to Apple Store and Google Play. The App was completed on time and budget for a major car event and succeeded to provide the expected services despite it was installed on several untested devices and with no significant issues. FESS is still involved in the Phase 2 of the implementation project which includes the deployment of new features and enhancements. Definitely appreciated the skill-set and the rational and calm approach to problem solving of their Project Lead Roshan Parmar.; ; Jaya and her team at Five Exceptions delivered a complex project for us, which combined content from 3 different Wordpress websites, and seamlessly integrated them into one. They also made improvements to our website security and design, and implemented SEO across the site also. All this was delivered on time, for a reasonable price, and in a very friendly, polite and professional manner. We at CALP would recommend them highly.; I ask them to create a server in Amazon Web Service (AWS), and they did an excelent job. They are very profesional, very kind, nice to work with, always wanted to help. Completelly recommended.; Five Exceptions was hired to develop a Shopify site for a key client.

LambdaTest,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2017,"Being a developer, responsive testing comes as a part of the package, every time I develop a webpage. I have been relying over LambdaTest for responsive testing. They have a feature which allows me to capture full page screenshots of my webpages in scores of different devices. I could even capture web pages that are locally hosted. And now, they have come up with a browser that lets me not only capture screenshots but interact with my websites in 25+ different devices, in a side by side view. That allows me to test my website responsiveness on a bunch of devices in a live-interactive manner. I must admit I am highly impressed by the LT browser and I am a tough guy to impress.; We use LambdaTest across our development & testing team. Our developers always perform cross browser tests on their local pages across different browsers and their versions before sending them to the testers. The integrations with 3rd party tools make it more useful. It provides a full development environment that looks very close to the real thing.Before we started using LambdaTest, we're limited to the browsers and their versions that are available on our desktops and laptops. But now with LambdaTest, we are using Selenium grid of 2000+ browsers and their versions available on the platform.If you want a solution to replace testing infrastructure that is hard to main and look after, LambdaTest is the best solution according to us.; Have been using Lambdatest for around 1 year now, and could say that it’s a useful testing tool for our team. Offering great combinations of browsers and operating systems for you to test on and most importantly there are many types of additional logs that come with each test which helps in debugging.. Glad to see the integration with Travis CI due to which we could optimally use this tool with our CI CD pipelines directly. We were able to effectively run TestNG and Selenium tests using their documentation and as an added advantage their support team is quick and helpful.; The industry we function (e-commerce) has a broad category of audience. We need to make sure our website is accessible to everyone irrespective of the browser / operating system they use. Ofcourse, responsive web design check is a major bullet point over our testing checklist as well. As a B2C, it's crucial for us to stay ahead of the customers and we wanted a solution which could help us ensure our changes would work seamlessly when shipped to the Production. LambdaTest made a great fit here when considered the latest browsers on the product, ability to test local pages along with a complimentary access to LT browser which is an absolute delight for our developers and testers. It helps us save a considerable effort on responsive testing plus the native developer tools allow us to dig deep into any UI mismatch! Also As mentioned we could achieve wider test coverage in time by running multiple combinations of browsers in parallel with LambdaTest automation suite. Our director to purchase the subscription was due to their affordable pricing for the parallel tests and the communication from the support team!; Running tests serially can be a good option when your product is at an early stage. But as we scaled the product, we needed a tool to reduce test time execution and pace up our test cycles. LambdaTest simplified the Selenium testing experience for us with their cloud based platform which allowed us to execute our test cases in parallel on hundreds of browsers. We could easily automate the test cases, get the sessions recorded and share the test reports across the team for assessment using Asana integration. We even leverage the integration with CircleCI to run automated tests on LambdaTest through our pipeline. The CircleCI Orb is handy for testing our privately hosted application.It’s good to see now that using LambdaTest we could run multiple tests on multiple VM’s, saving us hours of testing time and maintenance cost of local infrastructure. Personally, one thing that LambdaTest does very well is continuing to provide tutorials for testing, so that we stay up to speed and are even able to learn new things.I definitely saw myself applying a lot of the new concepts that I learned from their blogs.; As technology advances, enterprises are switching from manual testing to Selenium Test Automation. But one area most enterprises are still struggling is with the scalability of running several tests in parallel. LambdaTest has been a boon for us when it comes to Selenium automation. With a Selenium Grid based on the cloud, we don't need to stress about setting up and maintaining infrastructure anymore. We can run hundreds of tests in parallel on 2000+ browsers and OS versions running on real machines. LambdaTest really helped us in reducing our web testing cost and at the same time scale it as and when required.To leverage on marketing campaigns, we needed to ensure all our deliverables render seamlessly on different mobile and desktop browsers our users use to view them from across the world. The geolocation testing functionality helped us set the location and test our website over various locations. At LambdaTest, we can now run geolocation testing to test our website across 40+ countries. The pricing plan is pretty simple and easy to grasp, with no hidden costs at all.; We needed a testing tool that was scalable enough to cover all the browsers and OS as per our clients requirement and at the same time integrate well into our workflow. Lambdatest provided us with the necessary features to meet our browser compatibility testing requirements. Without any hassle of configuring, installing or maintaining the virtual machines, we are able to launch local browser tests instantly. The best part is, Lambdatest also helps us run our Selenium based automated tests on its cloud infra - that too without burning a hole in our pocket. They offer extensive mobile and desktop browsers, thereby increasing our test coverage to maximum.; We serve a variety of clients across industries, thus we need to make sure our website is accessible from every desktop, mobile browser combination they use. Responsive web design is an integral part of our testing process. As a B2B, you want to make sure that your services are always a step ahead of your customers. And to achieve that, it's important to have a tool that keeps your code and web designing process in sync with the Production.LambdaTest's variety of browsers and local testing capabilities made it a perfect fit for our requirements. Additionally we got free access to LT Browser which is absolutely loved by our developers. We are now in a better position while tackling misbehaving websites with the help of it’s inbuilt dev tools. The best part is that LambdaTest offers an automated parallel testing that helped us achieve faster and wider test coverage over multiple browsers. Its affordable price and fast technical support made the purchase decision very easy for the team. And yes I absolutely love their support staff. They are truly available for 24*7.; While we develop our web applications, our top concern was to verify the unintentional changes to the application's visuals. We need to make sure that changing one component doesn't break the styling of another component. LambdaTest's Smart testing helped us to identify visual regression bugs for every new build. We could capture our website screenshots belonging to different environments i.e stage and production & upload them on the LambdaTest Visual Testing platform. We were able to discover visual deviations with pixel to pixel comparison by capturing screenshots, comparing them against the baseline image, and highlighting visual changes. The slider mode is very helpful to compare the visual discrepancies between the two images by toggling them. Overall, Smart testing helped us perform reliable visual testing at scale and eliminated the risk of delivering visual bugs."
Serverspace,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2019,"First of all I would like to thank Serverspace for this great platform! Out of other VPS services, this is my favorite, it offers me the flexibility to enhance my skills as a Full-Stack Developer as well as a server administrator. Well out of frustrations from other VPS services, since they have a lot of hassle to work on, this platform enabled me to easily pick my choice, add new memory capability just by a few clicks. I observed the great UI/UX of this platform, and I am planning to use this forever until this platform is still working.; I tried many cloud server providers like AWS, Azure, Google cloud and more but they didn't satisfy my needs but when I tried Serverspace I was shocked because of their server prices, for a startup that will be the best option, I saw that the price is low but the service is best as expensive, I am fully satisfied with this. I recommend Serverspace for startups once a time you see, a cybercriminal attacked my server in serverspace but... the company has reported me on time, so I saved my server from further attacks, Serverspace saved a lot of time and money.; What I like about this company is the many options offered to us customers since I'm a Windows/Linux User and most of my needs rely on multi-OS systems. That's why I run 4 servers with ServerSpace. Their Windows Machines are as good as you can imagine, they offer all the alternatives I need, and I also run servers with CentOS. With Serverspace, I can cover all my needs for my business, and the best part is I also have different options on the payment side. They only charge me for the current use and not a whole monthly amount in advance, and I can cancel any server I ordered at any second. Also, their support tickets get answered right away. It's pretty good. What I think they could do better is improve their automatic system detecting payments with Ever. Every time I pay with Ever, I have to send a support ticket with transaction ID and all info about the payment to add funds. I get a reply the same day, but I'd rather not have to notify it. I'm very happy with this service, and I'll; I tried six to seven cloud services before I settled with Serverspace. I am glad that I found it. All I need was a reliable, scalable, economical, and user-friendly server for my data crunching and web application. First, their pricing is way attractive. The bigger sites may start with some low teaser rates or even free credits, but their prices go up exponentially with more CPU and memory. Serverspace's pricing remains very reasonable. Granted they don't offer super big servers, I don't need them either. The other thing I like is that they charge significantly less when you turn off the server while other sites charge you the same. I like their simple offers; simple servers that let me build my own environments. The plethora of bells and whistles elsewhere turn me off. Their servers are generally reliable except they failed to turn on a couple of times. But they fixed it promptly and were responsive through the process. Their clean and intuitive web UI is helpful.; I work most of the time but I also trade forex to make some extra money. Since I am not always at home, I had to get an expert advisor for my trades and that was when I started looking for a reliable VPS service. I have been using Serverspace VPS for less than a year now and I can say it has been a peaceful experience in the sense that I never had to worry about shutting down of the server. It's very pocket-friendly and I like that I can pay daily as I use it. What I enjoy most is the option to shutdown a server without deleting or destroying it completely, that way I can restart the server when I need it and continue using it. Like I said, you only get charged for what you use. For a little fee, you also have the option to increase the size or speed of a VPS server if your work becomes bigger without having to get a new server. I can only hope to get more than 50 Mbps speed for the fixed plan as it takes more time to work when everything is so slow.; I have been using Serverspace for about 6 months now. System performance is good. I have never used a VPS before, so I need some help getting up and running. Support always answers back thru a support ticket, although you may have to wait up to 6 hours sometimes, the support is good. Their pricing has been great, and I plan to stay with the service.; Before I decided to use their servers to host our services, I checked out and tried many alternatives. Some time ago I found Serverspace at some offers comparer and I decided to give it a try and I'm really satisfied. There are no problems with servers which I met using servers from others. So at the moment, I think I will use Serverspace servers for my other projects and initiatives.; I like Serverspace! The relation between the purchase price and the performance is perfect. I like dealing with you because of the cheap prices and high performance. Also, the support team is fast, I always get my tickets resolved as fast as possible. The deployment of services is also fast. In general, I do have a good experience and would like to build a long-term relationship.; The uptime and the speed of the service are fantastic. The quality of support is second to none. Every time I need help, I get a very personalized answer and they always go the extra mile to solve my problem. I have tried many competitors in the past but none of them come close to the quality of service I am getting in Serverspace."

The final project was delivered and implemented without major complications. Currently the Codebay team provides us with support and system updates.; We hire them for the development of a web application. A member of their team, Luis Sanchez was in charge of the project, we had several meetings to define the content and structure of the first sites. Later, he presented us graphic proposals and based on this, they began to develop. During development there were adjustments; Comparing them with the company I had worked with before, their communications are way superior. I always know exactly what they're working on, specifically the stage of the process where they're at. In addition, they're always upfront whenever things might take longer than expected. However, for the most part, they've completed things in a timely manner or even ahead of schedule.; We started working with a cloud specialist, who reviewed our current systems and implemented a work plan to migrate to the cloud.

$25 - $49/hr ",2004,"We are a startup fintech company and needed to develop a mobile app in iOS and Android. The app is a social media platform for investing with back end analytics similar to Twitter. The development required integration with a high end data provider and a separate charting platform. After interviewing multiple (8) companies, I selected Alliancetek because they were experienced, offered end to end solutions beyond a standard mobile app firm, and their price point was below competing firms.Alliancetek delivered on all promises with great professionalism. We had to pivot several times in the course of the project and each hurdle was handled without a hitch. My “team” consisted of 3 Alliancetek employees (1 project manager, 1 iOS developer, 1 Android developer) who I spoke with weekly through Microsoft Team meetings. There were additional back end developers who worked on the project. I had an outstanding experience and give Alliancetek my highest recommendation.; My company was close to the launch date for a software platform that allows aspiring US college athletes to get recruited. It was a complex system involving many different elements, user types and features. With our primary in-house developer, we were running very late on our development schedule. We had a few months left to finish off the system before our customers began to use it. We brought AllianceTek on and they helped us get over the line with their amazing, responsive and high quality work. Without their tremendous work, we would not have been able to get over the line and give our customers a product that would be helpful to them. AllianceTek were honestly a game changer, and I could not imagine being where we are today as a company without their heavy and continued involvement.; The project has moved extremely smooth. The communication, the Dev team, I mean all of you guys over at Alliance Tech have just blown away my expectations and I can't thank you guys enough for helping me bring this idea into a reality. This is going to, not just revolutionise the industry, but revolutionise sales training in general. it's going to be able to present different scenarios, to the training platform getting feedback and uploading their videos to train to where we can train hundreds of people at the same time. I mean guys, this software that you guys have helped bring to life is truly going to change the industry.; Sokolis Group has been working with AllianceTek for almost a decade. We partnered with them to design and build a proprietary application that is critical to our business for analyzing and reporting our clients' fuel transaction data. Over the years, we have continued to work with AllianceTek to develop new features which helped make our business more efficient and our reporting to clients more insightful. In addition, AllianceTek provides the hosting and maintenance for this cloud-based application and we trust them to handle this important responsibility. They are a valued partner to our business and I would not hesitate to recommend them.; I work for a boutique leadership and communication consulting firm. As part of our service offerings, we provide clients a private and secure performance / developmental review site where employees are able to provide one another feedback on a regular cadence. We initially used an internal site, but as the scale of our projects and clients began to increase, we knew we needed to increase the sophistication of our site. That's where AllianceTek came in. Working together hand-in-hand, we developed a site tailored to the needs of our clients. Since development of the site, we've had clients ask for increased personalization and customization, and AllianceTek has been able to help us develop these in an expedient and efficient manner. Another bonus is that even after several years of working together, we've had the same points of contact throughout. This has been an invaluable part of us working together so well. After the past few years of working together, I couldn't recommend AllianceTek highly enough.; ; AllianceTek has delivered outstanding products and services which has helped Strategas achieve outstanding recognition from our financial services clients. Beyond those technical achievements, what sets this team apart from the crowd is the rapid responsiveness to my requests, be it a production problem, coding change, or business challenge; that kind of responsiveness is an exceptional work ethic not frequently seen in our industry and highly valued by my firm. I can always count upon this team to respond in kind with their best efforts.; ; "

I must be one of their satisfied customers and will not have any reservation referring their service anyone.Keep up the good job and thank you.Rashid Hassan; I had the opportunity to involve Five Exceptions Software Solution (FESS) in the implementation of a new Mobile App for iOS and Android. The App required strong experience in the geo-positioning of cars and real time speed-position-distance calculation. We started with a very detailed functional specification from which FESS was able to quickly understand the requirements and to derive technical specs autonomously. Despite some initial troubles on optimizing the algorithm for distance, speed and average speed calculation, FESS went definitely extra miles on code refinement and bug resolution and actively contributed to the submission of the App to Apple Store and Google Play.

Their team, despite the pandemic and issues that were associated with it, were still able to continue with the project, and deliver the outcomes I was hoping for.

LambdaTest,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2017,"Being a developer, responsive testing comes as a part of the package, every time I develop a webpage. I have been relying over LambdaTest for responsive testing. They have a feature which allows me to capture full page screenshots of my webpages in scores of different devices. I could even capture web pages that are locally hosted. And now, they have come up with a browser that lets me not only capture screenshots but interact with my websites in 25+ different devices, in a side by side view. That allows me to test my website responsiveness on a bunch of devices in a live-interactive manner. I must admit I am highly impressed by the LT browser and I am a tough guy to impress.; We use LambdaTest across our development & testing team. Our developers always perform cross browser tests on their local pages across different browsers and their versions before sending them to the testers. The integrations with 3rd party tools make it more useful. It provides a full development environment that looks very close to the real thing.Before we started using LambdaTest, we're limited to the browsers and their versions that are available on our desktops and laptops. But now with LambdaTest, we are using Selenium grid of 2000+ browsers and their versions available on the platform.If you want a solution to replace testing infrastructure that is hard to main and look after, LambdaTest is the best solution according to us.; Have been using Lambdatest for around 1 year now, and could say that it’s a useful testing tool for our team. Offering great combinations of browsers and operating systems for you to test on and most importantly there are many types of additional logs that come with each test which helps in debugging.. Glad to see the integration with Travis CI due to which we could optimally use this tool with our CI CD pipelines directly. We were able to effectively run TestNG and Selenium tests using their documentation and as an added advantage their support team is quick and helpful.; The industry we function (e-commerce) has a broad category of audience. We need to make sure our website is accessible to everyone irrespective of the browser / operating system they use. Ofcourse, responsive web design check is a major bullet point over our testing checklist as well. As a B2C, it's crucial for us to stay ahead of the customers and we wanted a solution which could help us ensure our changes would work seamlessly when shipped to the Production. LambdaTest made a great fit here when considered the latest browsers on the product, ability to test local pages along with a complimentary access to LT browser which is an absolute delight for our developers and testers. It helps us save a considerable effort on responsive testing plus the native developer tools allow us to dig deep into any UI mismatch! Also As mentioned we could achieve wider test coverage in time by running multiple combinations of browsers in parallel with LambdaTest automation suite. Our director to purchase the subscription was due to their affordable pricing for the parallel tests and the communication from the support team!; Running tests serially can be a good option when your product is at an early stage. But as we scaled the product, we needed a tool to reduce test time execution and pace up our test cycles. LambdaTest simplified the Selenium testing experience for us with their cloud based platform which allowed us to execute our test cases in parallel on hundreds of browsers. We could easily automate the test cases, get the sessions recorded and share the test reports across the team for assessment using Asana integration. We even leverage the integration with CircleCI to run automated tests on LambdaTest through our pipeline. The CircleCI Orb is handy for testing our privately hosted application.It’s good to see now that using LambdaTest we could run multiple tests on multiple VM’s, saving us hours of testing time and maintenance cost of local infrastructure. Personally, one thing that LambdaTest does very well is continuing to provide tutorials for testing, so that we stay up to speed and are even able to learn new things.I definitely saw myself applying a lot of the new concepts that I learned from their blogs.; As technology advances, enterprises are switching from manual testing to Selenium Test Automation. But one area most enterprises are still struggling is with the scalability of running several tests in parallel. LambdaTest has been a boon for us when it comes to Selenium automation. With a Selenium Grid based on the cloud, we don't need to stress about setting up and maintaining infrastructure anymore. We can run hundreds of tests in parallel on 2000+ browsers and OS versions running on real machines. LambdaTest really helped us in reducing our web testing cost and at the same time scale it as and when required.To leverage on marketing campaigns, we needed to ensure all our deliverables render seamlessly on different mobile and desktop browsers our users use to view them from across the world. The geolocation testing functionality helped us set the location and test our website over various locations. At LambdaTest, we can now run geolocation testing to test our website across 40+ countries. The pricing plan is pretty simple and easy to grasp, with no hidden costs at all.; We needed a testing tool that was scalable enough to cover all the browsers and OS as per our clients requirement and at the same time integrate well into our workflow. Lambdatest provided us with the necessary features to meet our browser compatibility testing requirements. Without any hassle of configuring, installing or maintaining the virtual machines, we are able to launch local browser tests instantly. The best part is, Lambdatest also helps us run our Selenium based automated tests on its cloud infra - that too without burning a hole in our pocket. They offer extensive mobile and desktop browsers, thereby increasing our test coverage to maximum.; We serve a variety of clients across industries, thus we need to make sure our website is accessible from every desktop, mobile browser combination they use. Responsive web design is an integral part of our testing process. As a B2B, you want to make sure that your services are always a step ahead of your customers. And to achieve that, it's important to have a tool that keeps your code and web designing process in sync with the Production.LambdaTest's variety of browsers and local testing capabilities made it a perfect fit for our requirements. Additionally we got free access to LT Browser which is absolutely loved by our developers. We are now in a better position while tackling misbehaving websites with the help of it’s inbuilt dev tools. The best part is that LambdaTest offers an automated parallel testing that helped us achieve faster and wider test coverage over multiple browsers. Its affordable price and fast technical support made the purchase decision very easy for the team. And yes I absolutely love their support staff. They are truly available for 24*7.; While we develop our web applications, our top concern was to verify the unintentional changes to the application's visuals. We need to make sure that changing one component doesn't break the styling of another component. LambdaTest's Smart testing helped us to identify visual regression bugs for every new build. We could capture our website screenshots belonging to different environments i.e stage and production & upload them on the LambdaTest Visual Testing platform. We were able to discover visual deviations with pixel to pixel comparison by capturing screenshots, comparing them against the baseline image, and highlighting visual changes. The slider mode is very helpful to compare the visual discrepancies between the two images by toggling them. Overall, Smart testing helped us perform reliable visual testing at scale and eliminated the risk of delivering visual bugs."
Serverspace,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2019,"First of all I would like to thank Serverspace for this great platform! Out of other VPS services, this is my favorite, it offers me the flexibility to enhance my skills as a Full-Stack Developer as well as a server administrator. Well out of frustrations from other VPS services, since they have a lot of hassle to work on, this platform enabled me to easily pick my choice, add new memory capability just by a few clicks. I observed the great UI/UX of this platform, and I am planning to use this forever until this platform is still working.; I tried many cloud server providers like AWS, Azure, Google cloud and more but they didn't satisfy my needs but when I tried Serverspace I was shocked because of their server prices, for a startup that will be the best option, I saw that the price is low but the service is best as expensive, I am fully satisfied with this. I recommend Serverspace for startups once a time you see, a cybercriminal attacked my server in serverspace but... the company has reported me on time, so I saved my server from further attacks, Serverspace saved a lot of time and money.; What I like about this company is the many options offered to us customers since I'm a Windows/Linux User and most of my needs rely on multi-OS systems. That's why I run 4 servers with ServerSpace. Their Windows Machines are as good as you can imagine, they offer all the alternatives I need, and I also run servers with CentOS. With Serverspace, I can cover all my needs for my business, and the best part is I also have different options on the payment side. They only charge me for the current use and not a whole monthly amount in advance, and I can cancel any server I ordered at any second. Also, their support tickets get answered right away. It's pretty good. What I think they could do better is improve their automatic system detecting payments with Ever. Every time I pay with Ever, I have to send a support ticket with transaction ID and all info about the payment to add funds. I get a reply the same day, but I'd rather not have to notify it. I'm very happy with this service, and I'll; I tried six to seven cloud services before I settled with Serverspace. I am glad that I found it. All I need was a reliable, scalable, economical, and user-friendly server for my data crunching and web application. First, their pricing is way attractive. The bigger sites may start with some low teaser rates or even free credits, but their prices go up exponentially with more CPU and memory. Serverspace's pricing remains very reasonable. Granted they don't offer super big servers, I don't need them either. The other thing I like is that they charge significantly less when you turn off the server while other sites charge you the same. I like their simple offers; simple servers that let me build my own environments. The plethora of bells and whistles elsewhere turn me off. Their servers are generally reliable except they failed to turn on a couple of times. But they fixed it promptly and were responsive through the process. Their clean and intuitive web UI is helpful.; I work most of the time but I also trade forex to make some extra money. Since I am not always at home, I had to get an expert advisor for my trades and that was when I started looking for a reliable VPS service. I have been using Serverspace VPS for less than a year now and I can say it has been a peaceful experience in the sense that I never had to worry about shutting down of the server. It's very pocket-friendly and I like that I can pay daily as I use it. What I enjoy most is the option to shutdown a server without deleting or destroying it completely, that way I can restart the server when I need it and continue using it. Like I said, you only get charged for what you use. For a little fee, you also have the option to increase the size or speed of a VPS server if your work becomes bigger without having to get a new server. I can only hope to get more than 50 Mbps speed for the fixed plan as it takes more time to work when everything is so slow.; I have been using Serverspace for about 6 months now. System performance is good. I have never used a VPS before, so I need some help getting up and running. Support always answers back thru a support ticket, although you may have to wait up to 6 hours sometimes, the support is good. Their pricing has been great, and I plan to stay with the service.; Before I decided to use their servers to host our services, I checked out and tried many alternatives. Some time ago I found Serverspace at some offers comparer and I decided to give it a try and I'm really satisfied. There are no problems with servers which I met using servers from others. So at the moment, I think I will use Serverspace servers for my other projects and initiatives.; I like Serverspace! The relation between the purchase price and the performance is perfect. I like dealing with you because of the cheap prices and high performance. Also, the support team is fast, I always get my tickets resolved as fast as possible. The deployment of services is also fast. In general, I do have a good experience and would like to build a long-term relationship.; The uptime and the speed of the service are fantastic. The quality of support is second to none. Every time I need help, I get a very personalized answer and they always go the extra mile to solve my problem. I have tried many competitors in the past but none of them come close to the quality of service I am getting in Serverspace."

Over the years, we have continued to work with AllianceTek to develop new features which helped make our business more efficient and our reporting to clients more insightful. In addition, AllianceTek provides the hosting and maintenance for this cloud-based application and we trust them to handle this important responsibility. They are a valued partner to our business and I would not hesitate to recommend them.; I work for a boutique leadership and communication consulting firm. As part of our service offerings, we provide clients a private and secure performance / developmental review site where employees are able to provide one another feedback on a regular cadence. We initially used an internal site, but as the scale of our projects and clients began to increase, we knew we needed to increase the sophistication of our site. That's where AllianceTek came in. Working together hand-in-hand, we developed a site tailored to the needs of our clients. Since development of the site, we've had clients ask for increased personalization and customization, and AllianceTek has been able to help us develop these in an expedient and efficient manner. Another bonus is that even after several years of working together, we've had the same points of contact throughout. This has been an invaluable part of us working together so well. After the past few years of working together, I couldn't recommend AllianceTek highly enough.; ; AllianceTek has delivered outstanding products and services which has helped Strategas achieve outstanding recognition from our financial services clients. Beyond those technical achievements, what sets this team apart from the crowd is the rapid responsiveness to my requests, be it a production problem, coding change, or business challenge; that kind of responsiveness is an exceptional work ethic not frequently seen in our industry and highly valued by my firm. I can always count upon this team to respond in kind with their best efforts.; ; "

< $25/hr ",2017,"Being a developer, responsive testing comes as a part of the package, every time I develop a webpage. I have been relying over LambdaTest for responsive testing. They have a feature which allows me to capture full page screenshots of my webpages in scores of different devices. I could even capture web pages that are locally hosted. And now, they have come up with a browser that lets me not only capture screenshots but interact with my websites in 25+ different devices, in a side by side view. That allows me to test my website responsiveness on a bunch of devices in a live-interactive manner. I must admit I am highly impressed by the LT browser and I am a tough guy to impress.; We use LambdaTest across our development & testing team. Our developers always perform cross browser tests on their local pages across different browsers and their versions before sending them to the testers. The integrations with 3rd party tools make it more useful. It provides a full development environment that looks very close to the real thing.Before we started using LambdaTest, we're limited to the browsers and their versions that are available on our desktops and laptops. But now with LambdaTest, we are using Selenium grid of 2000+ browsers and their versions available on the platform.If you want a solution to replace testing infrastructure that is hard to main and look after, LambdaTest is the best solution according to us.; Have been using Lambdatest for around 1 year now, and could say that it’s a useful testing tool for our team. Offering great combinations of browsers and operating systems for you to test on and most importantly there are many types of additional logs that come with each test which helps in debugging.. Glad to see the integration with Travis CI due to which we could optimally use this tool with our CI CD pipelines directly. We were able to effectively run TestNG and Selenium tests using their documentation and as an added advantage their support team is quick and helpful.; The industry we function (e-commerce) has a broad category of audience. We need to make sure our website is accessible to everyone irrespective of the browser / operating system they use. Ofcourse, responsive web design check is a major bullet point over our testing checklist as well. As a B2C, it's crucial for us to stay ahead of the customers and we wanted a solution which could help us ensure our changes would work seamlessly when shipped to the Production. LambdaTest made a great fit here when considered the latest browsers on the product, ability to test local pages along with a complimentary access to LT browser which is an absolute delight for our developers and testers. It helps us save a considerable effort on responsive testing plus the native developer tools allow us to dig deep into any UI mismatch! Also As mentioned we could achieve wider test coverage in time by running multiple combinations of browsers in parallel with LambdaTest automation suite. Our director to purchase the subscription was due to their affordable pricing for the parallel tests and the communication from the support team!; Running tests serially can be a good option when your product is at an early stage. But as we scaled the product, we needed a tool to reduce test time execution and pace up our test cycles. LambdaTest simplified the Selenium testing experience for us with their cloud based platform which allowed us to execute our test cases in parallel on hundreds of browsers. We could easily automate the test cases, get the sessions recorded and share the test reports across the team for assessment using Asana integration. We even leverage the integration with CircleCI to run automated tests on LambdaTest through our pipeline. The CircleCI Orb is handy for testing our privately hosted application.It’s good to see now that using LambdaTest we could run multiple tests on multiple VM’s, saving us hours of testing time and maintenance cost of local infrastructure. Personally, one thing that LambdaTest does very well is continuing to provide tutorials for testing, so that we stay up to speed and are even able to learn new things.I definitely saw myself applying a lot of the new concepts that I learned from their blogs.; As technology advances, enterprises are switching from manual testing to Selenium Test Automation. But one area most enterprises are still struggling is with the scalability of running several tests in parallel. LambdaTest has been a boon for us when it comes to Selenium automation. With a Selenium Grid based on the cloud, we don't need to stress about setting up and maintaining infrastructure anymore. We can run hundreds of tests in parallel on 2000+ browsers and OS versions running on real machines. LambdaTest really helped us in reducing our web testing cost and at the same time scale it as and when required.To leverage on marketing campaigns, we needed to ensure all our deliverables render seamlessly on different mobile and desktop browsers our users use to view them from across the world. The geolocation testing functionality helped us set the location and test our website over various locations. At LambdaTest, we can now run geolocation testing to test our website across 40+ countries. The pricing plan is pretty simple and easy to grasp, with no hidden costs at all.; We needed a testing tool that was scalable enough to cover all the browsers and OS as per our clients requirement and at the same time integrate well into our workflow. Lambdatest provided us with the necessary features to meet our browser compatibility testing requirements. Without any hassle of configuring, installing or maintaining the virtual machines, we are able to launch local browser tests instantly. The best part is, Lambdatest also helps us run our Selenium based automated tests on its cloud infra - that too without burning a hole in our pocket. They offer extensive mobile and desktop browsers, thereby increasing our test coverage to maximum.; We serve a variety of clients across industries, thus we need to make sure our website is accessible from every desktop, mobile browser combination they use. Responsive web design is an integral part of our testing process. As a B2B, you want to make sure that your services are always a step ahead of your customers. And to achieve that, it's important to have a tool that keeps your code and web designing process in sync with the Production.LambdaTest's variety of browsers and local testing capabilities made it a perfect fit for our requirements. Additionally we got free access to LT Browser which is absolutely loved by our developers. We are now in a better position while tackling misbehaving websites with the help of it’s inbuilt dev tools. The best part is that LambdaTest offers an automated parallel testing that helped us achieve faster and wider test coverage over multiple browsers. Its affordable price and fast technical support made the purchase decision very easy for the team. And yes I absolutely love their support staff. They are truly available for 24*7.; While we develop our web applications, our top concern was to verify the unintentional changes to the application's visuals. We need to make sure that changing one component doesn't break the styling of another component. LambdaTest's Smart testing helped us to identify visual regression bugs for every new build. We could capture our website screenshots belonging to different environments i.e stage and production & upload them on the LambdaTest Visual Testing platform. We were able to discover visual deviations with pixel to pixel comparison by capturing screenshots, comparing them against the baseline image, and highlighting visual changes. The slider mode is very helpful to compare the visual discrepancies between the two images by toggling them. Overall, Smart testing helped us perform reliable visual testing at scale and eliminated the risk of delivering visual bugs."
Serverspace,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2019,"First of all I would like to thank Serverspace for this great platform! Out of other VPS services, this is my favorite, it offers me the flexibility to enhance my skills as a Full-Stack Developer as well as a server administrator. Well out of frustrations from other VPS services, since they have a lot of hassle to work on, this platform enabled me to easily pick my choice, add new memory capability just by a few clicks. I observed the great UI/UX of this platform, and I am planning to use this forever until this platform is still working.; I tried many cloud server providers like AWS, Azure, Google cloud and more but they didn't satisfy my needs but when I tried Serverspace I was shocked because of their server prices, for a startup that will be the best option, I saw that the price is low but the service is best as expensive, I am fully satisfied with this. I recommend Serverspace for startups once a time you see, a cybercriminal attacked my server in serverspace but... the company has reported me on time, so I saved my server from further attacks, Serverspace saved a lot of time and money.; What I like about this company is the many options offered to us customers since I'm a Windows/Linux User and most of my needs rely on multi-OS systems. That's why I run 4 servers with ServerSpace. Their Windows Machines are as good as you can imagine, they offer all the alternatives I need, and I also run servers with CentOS. With Serverspace, I can cover all my needs for my business, and the best part is I also have different options on the payment side. They only charge me for the current use and not a whole monthly amount in advance, and I can cancel any server I ordered at any second. Also, their support tickets get answered right away. It's pretty good. What I think they could do better is improve their automatic system detecting payments with Ever. Every time I pay with Ever, I have to send a support ticket with transaction ID and all info about the payment to add funds. I get a reply the same day, but I'd rather not have to notify it. I'm very happy with this service, and I'll; I tried six to seven cloud services before I settled with Serverspace. I am glad that I found it. All I need was a reliable, scalable, economical, and user-friendly server for my data crunching and web application. First, their pricing is way attractive. The bigger sites may start with some low teaser rates or even free credits, but their prices go up exponentially with more CPU and memory. Serverspace's pricing remains very reasonable. Granted they don't offer super big servers, I don't need them either. The other thing I like is that they charge significantly less when you turn off the server while other sites charge you the same. I like their simple offers; simple servers that let me build my own environments. The plethora of bells and whistles elsewhere turn me off. Their servers are generally reliable except they failed to turn on a couple of times. But they fixed it promptly and were responsive through the process. Their clean and intuitive web UI is helpful.; I work most of the time but I also trade forex to make some extra money. Since I am not always at home, I had to get an expert advisor for my trades and that was when I started looking for a reliable VPS service. I have been using Serverspace VPS for less than a year now and I can say it has been a peaceful experience in the sense that I never had to worry about shutting down of the server. It's very pocket-friendly and I like that I can pay daily as I use it. What I enjoy most is the option to shutdown a server without deleting or destroying it completely, that way I can restart the server when I need it and continue using it. Like I said, you only get charged for what you use. For a little fee, you also have the option to increase the size or speed of a VPS server if your work becomes bigger without having to get a new server. I can only hope to get more than 50 Mbps speed for the fixed plan as it takes more time to work when everything is so slow.; I have been using Serverspace for about 6 months now. System performance is good. I have never used a VPS before, so I need some help getting up and running. Support always answers back thru a support ticket, although you may have to wait up to 6 hours sometimes, the support is good. Their pricing has been great, and I plan to stay with the service.; Before I decided to use their servers to host our services, I checked out and tried many alternatives. Some time ago I found Serverspace at some offers comparer and I decided to give it a try and I'm really satisfied. There are no problems with servers which I met using servers from others. So at the moment, I think I will use Serverspace servers for my other projects and initiatives.; I like Serverspace! The relation between the purchase price and the performance is perfect. I like dealing with you because of the cheap prices and high performance. Also, the support team is fast, I always get my tickets resolved as fast as possible. The deployment of services is also fast. In general, I do have a good experience and would like to build a long-term relationship.; The uptime and the speed of the service are fantastic. The quality of support is second to none. Every time I need help, I get a very personalized answer and they always go the extra mile to solve my problem. I have tried many competitors in the past but none of them come close to the quality of service I am getting in Serverspace."

After interviewing multiple (8) companies, I selected Alliancetek because they were experienced, offered end to end solutions beyond a standard mobile app firm, and their price point was below competing firms.Alliancetek delivered on all promises with great professionalism. We had to pivot several times in the course of the project and each hurdle was handled without a hitch. My “team” consisted of 3 Alliancetek employees (1 project manager, 1 iOS developer, 1 Android developer) who I spoke with weekly through Microsoft Team meetings.

They don't use templates as standard, so could custom built to match my vision and created a website set-up that was completely bespoke to my needs.2. They took the time to listen to what I wanted but also brought their own ideas, experience, and creativity so that the end design was more rounded.3. They understood that I needed to see things in a visual context and have some flexibility to 'play' around with a few ideas. All of this was done face to face at their offices making the process highly personal.4.

I must be one of their satisfied customers and will not have any reservation referring their service anyone.Keep up the good job and thank you.Rashid Hassan; I had the opportunity to involve Five Exceptions Software Solution (FESS) in the implementation of a new Mobile App for iOS and Android. The App required strong experience in the geo-positioning of cars and real time speed-position-distance calculation. We started with a very detailed functional specification from which FESS was able to quickly understand the requirements and to derive technical specs autonomously. Despite some initial troubles on optimizing the algorithm for distance, speed and average speed calculation, FESS went definitely extra miles on code refinement and bug resolution and actively contributed to the submission of the App to Apple Store and Google Play. The App was completed on time and budget for a major car event and succeeded to provide the expected services despite it was installed on several untested devices and with no significant issues. FESS is still involved in the Phase 2 of the implementation project which includes the deployment of new features and enhancements. Definitely appreciated the skill-set and the rational and calm approach to problem solving of their Project Lead Roshan Parmar.; ; Jaya and her team at Five Exceptions delivered a complex project for us, which combined content from 3 different Wordpress websites, and seamlessly integrated them into one.

LambdaTest,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2017,"Being a developer, responsive testing comes as a part of the package, every time I develop a webpage. I have been relying over LambdaTest for responsive testing. They have a feature which allows me to capture full page screenshots of my webpages in scores of different devices. I could even capture web pages that are locally hosted. And now, they have come up with a browser that lets me not only capture screenshots but interact with my websites in 25+ different devices, in a side by side view. That allows me to test my website responsiveness on a bunch of devices in a live-interactive manner. I must admit I am highly impressed by the LT browser and I am a tough guy to impress.; We use LambdaTest across our development & testing team. Our developers always perform cross browser tests on their local pages across different browsers and their versions before sending them to the testers. The integrations with 3rd party tools make it more useful. It provides a full development environment that looks very close to the real thing.Before we started using LambdaTest, we're limited to the browsers and their versions that are available on our desktops and laptops. But now with LambdaTest, we are using Selenium grid of 2000+ browsers and their versions available on the platform.If you want a solution to replace testing infrastructure that is hard to main and look after, LambdaTest is the best solution according to us.; Have been using Lambdatest for around 1 year now, and could say that it’s a useful testing tool for our team. Offering great combinations of browsers and operating systems for you to test on and most importantly there are many types of additional logs that come with each test which helps in debugging.. Glad to see the integration with Travis CI due to which we could optimally use this tool with our CI CD pipelines directly. We were able to effectively run TestNG and Selenium tests using their documentation and as an added advantage their support team is quick and helpful.; The industry we function (e-commerce) has a broad category of audience. We need to make sure our website is accessible to everyone irrespective of the browser / operating system they use. Ofcourse, responsive web design check is a major bullet point over our testing checklist as well. As a B2C, it's crucial for us to stay ahead of the customers and we wanted a solution which could help us ensure our changes would work seamlessly when shipped to the Production. LambdaTest made a great fit here when considered the latest browsers on the product, ability to test local pages along with a complimentary access to LT browser which is an absolute delight for our developers and testers. It helps us save a considerable effort on responsive testing plus the native developer tools allow us to dig deep into any UI mismatch! Also As mentioned we could achieve wider test coverage in time by running multiple combinations of browsers in parallel with LambdaTest automation suite. Our director to purchase the subscription was due to their affordable pricing for the parallel tests and the communication from the support team!; Running tests serially can be a good option when your product is at an early stage. But as we scaled the product, we needed a tool to reduce test time execution and pace up our test cycles. LambdaTest simplified the Selenium testing experience for us with their cloud based platform which allowed us to execute our test cases in parallel on hundreds of browsers. We could easily automate the test cases, get the sessions recorded and share the test reports across the team for assessment using Asana integration. We even leverage the integration with CircleCI to run automated tests on LambdaTest through our pipeline. The CircleCI Orb is handy for testing our privately hosted application.It’s good to see now that using LambdaTest we could run multiple tests on multiple VM’s, saving us hours of testing time and maintenance cost of local infrastructure. Personally, one thing that LambdaTest does very well is continuing to provide tutorials for testing, so that we stay up to speed and are even able to learn new things.I definitely saw myself applying a lot of the new concepts that I learned from their blogs.; As technology advances, enterprises are switching from manual testing to Selenium Test Automation. But one area most enterprises are still struggling is with the scalability of running several tests in parallel. LambdaTest has been a boon for us when it comes to Selenium automation. With a Selenium Grid based on the cloud, we don't need to stress about setting up and maintaining infrastructure anymore. We can run hundreds of tests in parallel on 2000+ browsers and OS versions running on real machines. LambdaTest really helped us in reducing our web testing cost and at the same time scale it as and when required.To leverage on marketing campaigns, we needed to ensure all our deliverables render seamlessly on different mobile and desktop browsers our users use to view them from across the world. The geolocation testing functionality helped us set the location and test our website over various locations. At LambdaTest, we can now run geolocation testing to test our website across 40+ countries. The pricing plan is pretty simple and easy to grasp, with no hidden costs at all.; We needed a testing tool that was scalable enough to cover all the browsers and OS as per our clients requirement and at the same time integrate well into our workflow. Lambdatest provided us with the necessary features to meet our browser compatibility testing requirements. Without any hassle of configuring, installing or maintaining the virtual machines, we are able to launch local browser tests instantly. The best part is, Lambdatest also helps us run our Selenium based automated tests on its cloud infra - that too without burning a hole in our pocket. They offer extensive mobile and desktop browsers, thereby increasing our test coverage to maximum.; We serve a variety of clients across industries, thus we need to make sure our website is accessible from every desktop, mobile browser combination they use. Responsive web design is an integral part of our testing process. As a B2B, you want to make sure that your services are always a step ahead of your customers. And to achieve that, it's important to have a tool that keeps your code and web designing process in sync with the Production.LambdaTest's variety of browsers and local testing capabilities made it a perfect fit for our requirements. Additionally we got free access to LT Browser which is absolutely loved by our developers. We are now in a better position while tackling misbehaving websites with the help of it’s inbuilt dev tools. The best part is that LambdaTest offers an automated parallel testing that helped us achieve faster and wider test coverage over multiple browsers. Its affordable price and fast technical support made the purchase decision very easy for the team. And yes I absolutely love their support staff. They are truly available for 24*7.; While we develop our web applications, our top concern was to verify the unintentional changes to the application's visuals. We need to make sure that changing one component doesn't break the styling of another component. LambdaTest's Smart testing helped us to identify visual regression bugs for every new build. We could capture our website screenshots belonging to different environments i.e stage and production & upload them on the LambdaTest Visual Testing platform. We were able to discover visual deviations with pixel to pixel comparison by capturing screenshots, comparing them against the baseline image, and highlighting visual changes. The slider mode is very helpful to compare the visual discrepancies between the two images by toggling them. Overall, Smart testing helped us perform reliable visual testing at scale and eliminated the risk of delivering visual bugs."
Serverspace,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2019,"First of all I would like to thank Serverspace for this great platform! Out of other VPS services, this is my favorite, it offers me the flexibility to enhance my skills as a Full-Stack Developer as well as a server administrator. Well out of frustrations from other VPS services, since they have a lot of hassle to work on, this platform enabled me to easily pick my choice, add new memory capability just by a few clicks. I observed the great UI/UX of this platform, and I am planning to use this forever until this platform is still working.; I tried many cloud server providers like AWS, Azure, Google cloud and more but they didn't satisfy my needs but when I tried Serverspace I was shocked because of their server prices, for a startup that will be the best option, I saw that the price is low but the service is best as expensive, I am fully satisfied with this. I recommend Serverspace for startups once a time you see, a cybercriminal attacked my server in serverspace but... the company has reported me on time, so I saved my server from further attacks, Serverspace saved a lot of time and money.; What I like about this company is the many options offered to us customers since I'm a Windows/Linux User and most of my needs rely on multi-OS systems. That's why I run 4 servers with ServerSpace. Their Windows Machines are as good as you can imagine, they offer all the alternatives I need, and I also run servers with CentOS. With Serverspace, I can cover all my needs for my business, and the best part is I also have different options on the payment side. They only charge me for the current use and not a whole monthly amount in advance, and I can cancel any server I ordered at any second. Also, their support tickets get answered right away. It's pretty good. What I think they could do better is improve their automatic system detecting payments with Ever. Every time I pay with Ever, I have to send a support ticket with transaction ID and all info about the payment to add funds. I get a reply the same day, but I'd rather not have to notify it. I'm very happy with this service, and I'll; I tried six to seven cloud services before I settled with Serverspace. I am glad that I found it. All I need was a reliable, scalable, economical, and user-friendly server for my data crunching and web application. First, their pricing is way attractive. The bigger sites may start with some low teaser rates or even free credits, but their prices go up exponentially with more CPU and memory. Serverspace's pricing remains very reasonable. Granted they don't offer super big servers, I don't need them either. The other thing I like is that they charge significantly less when you turn off the server while other sites charge you the same. I like their simple offers; simple servers that let me build my own environments. The plethora of bells and whistles elsewhere turn me off. Their servers are generally reliable except they failed to turn on a couple of times. But they fixed it promptly and were responsive through the process. Their clean and intuitive web UI is helpful.; I work most of the time but I also trade forex to make some extra money. Since I am not always at home, I had to get an expert advisor for my trades and that was when I started looking for a reliable VPS service. I have been using Serverspace VPS for less than a year now and I can say it has been a peaceful experience in the sense that I never had to worry about shutting down of the server. It's very pocket-friendly and I like that I can pay daily as I use it. What I enjoy most is the option to shutdown a server without deleting or destroying it completely, that way I can restart the server when I need it and continue using it. Like I said, you only get charged for what you use. For a little fee, you also have the option to increase the size or speed of a VPS server if your work becomes bigger without having to get a new server. I can only hope to get more than 50 Mbps speed for the fixed plan as it takes more time to work when everything is so slow.; I have been using Serverspace for about 6 months now. System performance is good. I have never used a VPS before, so I need some help getting up and running. Support always answers back thru a support ticket, although you may have to wait up to 6 hours sometimes, the support is good. Their pricing has been great, and I plan to stay with the service.; Before I decided to use their servers to host our services, I checked out and tried many alternatives. Some time ago I found Serverspace at some offers comparer and I decided to give it a try and I'm really satisfied. There are no problems with servers which I met using servers from others. So at the moment, I think I will use Serverspace servers for my other projects and initiatives.; I like Serverspace! The relation between the purchase price and the performance is perfect. I like dealing with you because of the cheap prices and high performance. Also, the support team is fast, I always get my tickets resolved as fast as possible. The deployment of services is also fast. In general, I do have a good experience and would like to build a long-term relationship.; The uptime and the speed of the service are fantastic. The quality of support is second to none. Every time I need help, I get a very personalized answer and they always go the extra mile to solve my problem. I have tried many competitors in the past but none of them come close to the quality of service I am getting in Serverspace."

The final project was delivered and implemented without major complications. Currently the Codebay team provides us with support and system updates.; We hire them for the development of a web application. A member of their team, Luis Sanchez was in charge of the project, we had several meetings to define the content and structure of the first sites.

The app is a social media platform for investing with back end analytics similar to Twitter. The development required integration with a high end data provider and a separate charting platform. After interviewing multiple (8) companies, I selected Alliancetek because they were experienced, offered end to end solutions beyond a standard mobile app firm, and their price point was below competing firms.Alliancetek delivered on all promises with great professionalism. We had to pivot several times in the course of the project and each hurdle was handled without a hitch. My “team” consisted of 3 Alliancetek employees (1 project manager, 1 iOS developer, 1 Android developer) who I spoke with weekly through Microsoft Team meetings. There were additional back end developers who worked on the project. I had an outstanding experience and give Alliancetek my highest recommendation.; My company was close to the launch date for a software platform that allows aspiring US college athletes to get recruited. It was a complex system involving many different elements, user types and features. With our primary in-house developer, we were running very late on our development schedule. We had a few months left to finish off the system before our customers began to use it. We brought AllianceTek on and they helped us get over the line with their amazing, responsive and high quality work. Without their tremendous work, we would not have been able to get over the line and give our customers a product that would be helpful to them. AllianceTek were honestly a game changer, and I could not imagine being where we are today as a company without their heavy and continued involvement.; The project has moved extremely smooth. The communication, the Dev team, I mean all of you guys over at Alliance Tech have just blown away my expectations and I can't thank you guys enough for helping me bring this idea into a reality. This is going to, not just revolutionise the industry, but revolutionise sales training in general. it's going to be able to present different scenarios, to the training platform getting feedback and uploading their videos to train to where we can train hundreds of people at the same time. I mean guys, this software that you guys have helped bring to life is truly going to change the industry.; Sokolis Group has been working with AllianceTek for almost a decade. We partnered with them to design and build a proprietary application that is critical to our business for analyzing and reporting our clients' fuel transaction data. Over the years, we have continued to work with AllianceTek to develop new features which helped make our business more efficient and our reporting to clients more insightful. In addition, AllianceTek provides the hosting and maintenance for this cloud-based application and we trust them to handle this important responsibility. They are a valued partner to our business and I would not hesitate to recommend them.; I work for a boutique leadership and communication consulting firm. As part of our service offerings, we provide clients a private and secure performance / developmental review site where employees are able to provide one another feedback on a regular cadence. We initially used an internal site, but as the scale of our projects and clients began to increase, we knew we needed to increase the sophistication of our site. That's where AllianceTek came in. Working together hand-in-hand, we developed a site tailored to the needs of our clients. Since development of the site, we've had clients ask for increased personalization and customization, and AllianceTek has been able to help us develop these in an expedient and efficient manner. Another bonus is that even after several years of working together, we've had the same points of contact throughout. This has been an invaluable part of us working together so well. After the past few years of working together, I couldn't recommend AllianceTek highly enough.; ; AllianceTek has delivered outstanding products and services which has helped Strategas achieve outstanding recognition from our financial services clients. Beyond those technical achievements, what sets this team apart from the crowd is the rapid responsiveness to my requests, be it a production problem, coding change, or business challenge; that kind of responsiveness is an exceptional work ethic not frequently seen in our industry and highly valued by my firm. I can always count upon this team to respond in kind with their best efforts.; ; "

Morever, while working on building the app, we found out that we were paying them but not getting anything. from our side we provided all the information and made the work clear and simple by following all the categories in our website and just apply them to build the app. in every little detail we had headache. They only showed us login page with some categories wireframes and took more than double the time needed to deliver the app moreover they gave us many solutions with ideas to build the app before they received the payments afterwards they showed us unprofessional behaviors like not answering our calls sending us emails that the job cannot be completed that will take more effort and time basically all the deal was a lie to get the money.I don't recommend this company to anyone maybe for projects less than 1000$ and I'm sure they will give you headache.At the end we asked for refund they don't refund nor provide anything no work nothingjust ask for more payments appventurez stole our money without delivering the work. we were deceived by this company. my advice never pay in advance to any company unless they build and show you the work.; Appventurez made it possible to realize the whole YuCee project from the very scratch to a fully functioning Platform with all imaginable features and management possibilities.

They have done a fantastic job to my company website and created a full blown Mobile App for us. They have been supporting us for the last two and half years. We are very satisfied with their work ethics and support. They are always available and respond promptly to all our needs. All tasks move through progressive stages until they are completed. Communication and correspondences are done on a very easy to follow portal and it is always clear and straight forward. Their charges and rates are quite reasonable. I must be one of their satisfied customers and will not have any reservation referring their service anyone.Keep up the good job and thank you.Rashid Hassan; I had the opportunity to involve Five Exceptions Software Solution (FESS) in the implementation of a new Mobile App for iOS and Android. The App required strong experience in the geo-positioning of cars and real time speed-position-distance calculation. We started with a very detailed functional specification from which FESS was able to quickly understand the requirements and to derive technical specs autonomously. Despite some initial troubles on optimizing the algorithm for distance, speed and average speed calculation, FESS went definitely extra miles on code refinement and bug resolution and actively contributed to the submission of the App to Apple Store and Google Play. The App was completed on time and budget for a major car event and succeeded to provide the expected services despite it was installed on several untested devices and with no significant issues. FESS is still involved in the Phase 2 of the implementation project which includes the deployment of new features and enhancements. Definitely appreciated the skill-set and the rational and calm approach to problem solving of their Project Lead Roshan Parmar.; ; Jaya and her team at Five Exceptions delivered a complex project for us, which combined content from 3 different Wordpress websites, and seamlessly integrated them into one. They also made improvements to our website security and design, and implemented SEO across the site also. All this was delivered on time, for a reasonable price, and in a very friendly, polite and professional manner. We at CALP would recommend them highly.; I ask them to create a server in Amazon Web Service (AWS), and they did an excelent job. They are very profesional, very kind, nice to work with, always wanted to help. Completelly recommended.; Five Exceptions was hired to develop a Shopify site for a key client.

LambdaTest,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2017,"Being a developer, responsive testing comes as a part of the package, every time I develop a webpage. I have been relying over LambdaTest for responsive testing. They have a feature which allows me to capture full page screenshots of my webpages in scores of different devices. I could even capture web pages that are locally hosted. And now, they have come up with a browser that lets me not only capture screenshots but interact with my websites in 25+ different devices, in a side by side view. That allows me to test my website responsiveness on a bunch of devices in a live-interactive manner. I must admit I am highly impressed by the LT browser and I am a tough guy to impress.; We use LambdaTest across our development & testing team. Our developers always perform cross browser tests on their local pages across different browsers and their versions before sending them to the testers. The integrations with 3rd party tools make it more useful. It provides a full development environment that looks very close to the real thing.Before we started using LambdaTest, we're limited to the browsers and their versions that are available on our desktops and laptops. But now with LambdaTest, we are using Selenium grid of 2000+ browsers and their versions available on the platform.If you want a solution to replace testing infrastructure that is hard to main and look after, LambdaTest is the best solution according to us.; Have been using Lambdatest for around 1 year now, and could say that it’s a useful testing tool for our team. Offering great combinations of browsers and operating systems for you to test on and most importantly there are many types of additional logs that come with each test which helps in debugging.. Glad to see the integration with Travis CI due to which we could optimally use this tool with our CI CD pipelines directly. We were able to effectively run TestNG and Selenium tests using their documentation and as an added advantage their support team is quick and helpful.; The industry we function (e-commerce) has a broad category of audience. We need to make sure our website is accessible to everyone irrespective of the browser / operating system they use. Ofcourse, responsive web design check is a major bullet point over our testing checklist as well. As a B2C, it's crucial for us to stay ahead of the customers and we wanted a solution which could help us ensure our changes would work seamlessly when shipped to the Production. LambdaTest made a great fit here when considered the latest browsers on the product, ability to test local pages along with a complimentary access to LT browser which is an absolute delight for our developers and testers. It helps us save a considerable effort on responsive testing plus the native developer tools allow us to dig deep into any UI mismatch! Also As mentioned we could achieve wider test coverage in time by running multiple combinations of browsers in parallel with LambdaTest automation suite. Our director to purchase the subscription was due to their affordable pricing for the parallel tests and the communication from the support team!; Running tests serially can be a good option when your product is at an early stage. But as we scaled the product, we needed a tool to reduce test time execution and pace up our test cycles. LambdaTest simplified the Selenium testing experience for us with their cloud based platform which allowed us to execute our test cases in parallel on hundreds of browsers. We could easily automate the test cases, get the sessions recorded and share the test reports across the team for assessment using Asana integration. We even leverage the integration with CircleCI to run automated tests on LambdaTest through our pipeline. The CircleCI Orb is handy for testing our privately hosted application.It’s good to see now that using LambdaTest we could run multiple tests on multiple VM’s, saving us hours of testing time and maintenance cost of local infrastructure. Personally, one thing that LambdaTest does very well is continuing to provide tutorials for testing, so that we stay up to speed and are even able to learn new things.I definitely saw myself applying a lot of the new concepts that I learned from their blogs.; As technology advances, enterprises are switching from manual testing to Selenium Test Automation. But one area most enterprises are still struggling is with the scalability of running several tests in parallel. LambdaTest has been a boon for us when it comes to Selenium automation. With a Selenium Grid based on the cloud, we don't need to stress about setting up and maintaining infrastructure anymore. We can run hundreds of tests in parallel on 2000+ browsers and OS versions running on real machines. LambdaTest really helped us in reducing our web testing cost and at the same time scale it as and when required.To leverage on marketing campaigns, we needed to ensure all our deliverables render seamlessly on different mobile and desktop browsers our users use to view them from across the world. The geolocation testing functionality helped us set the location and test our website over various locations. At LambdaTest, we can now run geolocation testing to test our website across 40+ countries. The pricing plan is pretty simple and easy to grasp, with no hidden costs at all.; We needed a testing tool that was scalable enough to cover all the browsers and OS as per our clients requirement and at the same time integrate well into our workflow. Lambdatest provided us with the necessary features to meet our browser compatibility testing requirements. Without any hassle of configuring, installing or maintaining the virtual machines, we are able to launch local browser tests instantly. The best part is, Lambdatest also helps us run our Selenium based automated tests on its cloud infra - that too without burning a hole in our pocket. They offer extensive mobile and desktop browsers, thereby increasing our test coverage to maximum.; We serve a variety of clients across industries, thus we need to make sure our website is accessible from every desktop, mobile browser combination they use. Responsive web design is an integral part of our testing process. As a B2B, you want to make sure that your services are always a step ahead of your customers. And to achieve that, it's important to have a tool that keeps your code and web designing process in sync with the Production.LambdaTest's variety of browsers and local testing capabilities made it a perfect fit for our requirements. Additionally we got free access to LT Browser which is absolutely loved by our developers. We are now in a better position while tackling misbehaving websites with the help of it’s inbuilt dev tools. The best part is that LambdaTest offers an automated parallel testing that helped us achieve faster and wider test coverage over multiple browsers. Its affordable price and fast technical support made the purchase decision very easy for the team. And yes I absolutely love their support staff. They are truly available for 24*7.; While we develop our web applications, our top concern was to verify the unintentional changes to the application's visuals. We need to make sure that changing one component doesn't break the styling of another component. LambdaTest's Smart testing helped us to identify visual regression bugs for every new build. We could capture our website screenshots belonging to different environments i.e stage and production & upload them on the LambdaTest Visual Testing platform. We were able to discover visual deviations with pixel to pixel comparison by capturing screenshots, comparing them against the baseline image, and highlighting visual changes. The slider mode is very helpful to compare the visual discrepancies between the two images by toggling them. Overall, Smart testing helped us perform reliable visual testing at scale and eliminated the risk of delivering visual bugs."
Serverspace,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2019,"First of all I would like to thank Serverspace for this great platform! Out of other VPS services, this is my favorite, it offers me the flexibility to enhance my skills as a Full-Stack Developer as well as a server administrator. Well out of frustrations from other VPS services, since they have a lot of hassle to work on, this platform enabled me to easily pick my choice, add new memory capability just by a few clicks. I observed the great UI/UX of this platform, and I am planning to use this forever until this platform is still working.; I tried many cloud server providers like AWS, Azure, Google cloud and more but they didn't satisfy my needs but when I tried Serverspace I was shocked because of their server prices, for a startup that will be the best option, I saw that the price is low but the service is best as expensive, I am fully satisfied with this. I recommend Serverspace for startups once a time you see, a cybercriminal attacked my server in serverspace but... the company has reported me on time, so I saved my server from further attacks, Serverspace saved a lot of time and money.; What I like about this company is the many options offered to us customers since I'm a Windows/Linux User and most of my needs rely on multi-OS systems. That's why I run 4 servers with ServerSpace. Their Windows Machines are as good as you can imagine, they offer all the alternatives I need, and I also run servers with CentOS. With Serverspace, I can cover all my needs for my business, and the best part is I also have different options on the payment side. They only charge me for the current use and not a whole monthly amount in advance, and I can cancel any server I ordered at any second. Also, their support tickets get answered right away. It's pretty good. What I think they could do better is improve their automatic system detecting payments with Ever. Every time I pay with Ever, I have to send a support ticket with transaction ID and all info about the payment to add funds. I get a reply the same day, but I'd rather not have to notify it. I'm very happy with this service, and I'll; I tried six to seven cloud services before I settled with Serverspace. I am glad that I found it. All I need was a reliable, scalable, economical, and user-friendly server for my data crunching and web application. First, their pricing is way attractive. The bigger sites may start with some low teaser rates or even free credits, but their prices go up exponentially with more CPU and memory. Serverspace's pricing remains very reasonable. Granted they don't offer super big servers, I don't need them either. The other thing I like is that they charge significantly less when you turn off the server while other sites charge you the same. I like their simple offers; simple servers that let me build my own environments. The plethora of bells and whistles elsewhere turn me off. Their servers are generally reliable except they failed to turn on a couple of times. But they fixed it promptly and were responsive through the process. Their clean and intuitive web UI is helpful.; I work most of the time but I also trade forex to make some extra money. Since I am not always at home, I had to get an expert advisor for my trades and that was when I started looking for a reliable VPS service. I have been using Serverspace VPS for less than a year now and I can say it has been a peaceful experience in the sense that I never had to worry about shutting down of the server. It's very pocket-friendly and I like that I can pay daily as I use it. What I enjoy most is the option to shutdown a server without deleting or destroying it completely, that way I can restart the server when I need it and continue using it. Like I said, you only get charged for what you use. For a little fee, you also have the option to increase the size or speed of a VPS server if your work becomes bigger without having to get a new server. I can only hope to get more than 50 Mbps speed for the fixed plan as it takes more time to work when everything is so slow.; I have been using Serverspace for about 6 months now. System performance is good. I have never used a VPS before, so I need some help getting up and running. Support always answers back thru a support ticket, although you may have to wait up to 6 hours sometimes, the support is good. Their pricing has been great, and I plan to stay with the service.; Before I decided to use their servers to host our services, I checked out and tried many alternatives. Some time ago I found Serverspace at some offers comparer and I decided to give it a try and I'm really satisfied. There are no problems with servers which I met using servers from others. So at the moment, I think I will use Serverspace servers for my other projects and initiatives.; I like Serverspace! The relation between the purchase price and the performance is perfect. I like dealing with you because of the cheap prices and high performance. Also, the support team is fast, I always get my tickets resolved as fast as possible. The deployment of services is also fast. In general, I do have a good experience and would like to build a long-term relationship.; The uptime and the speed of the service are fantastic. The quality of support is second to none. Every time I need help, I get a very personalized answer and they always go the extra mile to solve my problem. I have tried many competitors in the past but none of them come close to the quality of service I am getting in Serverspace."

The final project was delivered and implemented without major complications.

$25 - $49/hr ",2004,"We are a startup fintech company and needed to develop a mobile app in iOS and Android. The app is a social media platform for investing with back end analytics similar to Twitter. The development required integration with a high end data provider and a separate charting platform. After interviewing multiple (8) companies, I selected Alliancetek because they were experienced, offered end to end solutions beyond a standard mobile app firm, and their price point was below competing firms.Alliancetek delivered on all promises with great professionalism. We had to pivot several times in the course of the project and each hurdle was handled without a hitch. My “team” consisted of 3 Alliancetek employees (1 project manager, 1 iOS developer, 1 Android developer) who I spoke with weekly through Microsoft Team meetings. There were additional back end developers who worked on the project. I had an outstanding experience and give Alliancetek my highest recommendation.; My company was close to the launch date for a software platform that allows aspiring US college athletes to get recruited. It was a complex system involving many different elements, user types and features. With our primary in-house developer, we were running very late on our development schedule. We had a few months left to finish off the system before our customers began to use it. We brought AllianceTek on and they helped us get over the line with their amazing, responsive and high quality work. Without their tremendous work, we would not have been able to get over the line and give our customers a product that would be helpful to them. AllianceTek were honestly a game changer, and I could not imagine being where we are today as a company without their heavy and continued involvement.; The project has moved extremely smooth. The communication, the Dev team, I mean all of you guys over at Alliance Tech have just blown away my expectations and I can't thank you guys enough for helping me bring this idea into a reality. This is going to, not just revolutionise the industry, but revolutionise sales training in general. it's going to be able to present different scenarios, to the training platform getting feedback and uploading their videos to train to where we can train hundreds of people at the same time. I mean guys, this software that you guys have helped bring to life is truly going to change the industry.; Sokolis Group has been working with AllianceTek for almost a decade. We partnered with them to design and build a proprietary application that is critical to our business for analyzing and reporting our clients' fuel transaction data. Over the years, we have continued to work with AllianceTek to develop new features which helped make our business more efficient and our reporting to clients more insightful. In addition, AllianceTek provides the hosting and maintenance for this cloud-based application and we trust them to handle this important responsibility. They are a valued partner to our business and I would not hesitate to recommend them.; I work for a boutique leadership and communication consulting firm. As part of our service offerings, we provide clients a private and secure performance / developmental review site where employees are able to provide one another feedback on a regular cadence. We initially used an internal site, but as the scale of our projects and clients began to increase, we knew we needed to increase the sophistication of our site. That's where AllianceTek came in. Working together hand-in-hand, we developed a site tailored to the needs of our clients. Since development of the site, we've had clients ask for increased personalization and customization, and AllianceTek has been able to help us develop these in an expedient and efficient manner. Another bonus is that even after several years of working together, we've had the same points of contact throughout. This has been an invaluable part of us working together so well. After the past few years of working together, I couldn't recommend AllianceTek highly enough.; ; AllianceTek has delivered outstanding products and services which has helped Strategas achieve outstanding recognition from our financial services clients. Beyond those technical achievements, what sets this team apart from the crowd is the rapid responsiveness to my requests, be it a production problem, coding change, or business challenge; that kind of responsiveness is an exceptional work ethic not frequently seen in our industry and highly valued by my firm. I can always count upon this team to respond in kind with their best efforts.; ; "

They have done a fantastic job to my company website and created a full blown Mobile App for us. They have been supporting us for the last two and half years. We are very satisfied with their work ethics and support. They are always available and respond promptly to all our needs. All tasks move through progressive stages until they are completed. Communication and correspondences are done on a very easy to follow portal and it is always clear and straight forward. Their charges and rates are quite reasonable. I must be one of their satisfied customers and will not have any reservation referring their service anyone.Keep up the good job and thank you.Rashid Hassan; I had the opportunity to involve Five Exceptions Software Solution (FESS) in the implementation of a new Mobile App for iOS and Android. The App required strong experience in the geo-positioning of cars and real time speed-position-distance calculation. We started with a very detailed functional specification from which FESS was able to quickly understand the requirements and to derive technical specs autonomously. Despite some initial troubles on optimizing the algorithm for distance, speed and average speed calculation, FESS went definitely extra miles on code refinement and bug resolution and actively contributed to the submission of the App to Apple Store and Google Play. The App was completed on time and budget for a major car event and succeeded to provide the expected services despite it was installed on several untested devices and with no significant issues. FESS is still involved in the Phase 2 of the implementation project which includes the deployment of new features and enhancements. Definitely appreciated the skill-set and the rational and calm approach to problem solving of their Project Lead Roshan Parmar.; ; Jaya and her team at Five Exceptions delivered a complex project for us, which combined content from 3 different Wordpress websites, and seamlessly integrated them into one. They also made improvements to our website security and design, and implemented SEO across the site also. All this was delivered on time, for a reasonable price, and in a very friendly, polite and professional manner. We at CALP would recommend them highly.; I ask them to create a server in Amazon Web Service (AWS), and they did an excelent job. They are very profesional, very kind, nice to work with, always wanted to help. Completelly recommended.; Five Exceptions was hired to develop a Shopify site for a key client. They put together a skilled team who were able to execute on the design and were responsive to questions.; I have worked with many free lancers or overseas companies but the level of commitment for these guys has always been a dream.

Their team, despite the pandemic and issues that were associated with it, were still able to continue with the project, and deliver the outcomes I was hoping for.

LambdaTest,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2017,"Being a developer, responsive testing comes as a part of the package, every time I develop a webpage. I have been relying over LambdaTest for responsive testing. They have a feature which allows me to capture full page screenshots of my webpages in scores of different devices. I could even capture web pages that are locally hosted. And now, they have come up with a browser that lets me not only capture screenshots but interact with my websites in 25+ different devices, in a side by side view. That allows me to test my website responsiveness on a bunch of devices in a live-interactive manner. I must admit I am highly impressed by the LT browser and I am a tough guy to impress.; We use LambdaTest across our development & testing team. Our developers always perform cross browser tests on their local pages across different browsers and their versions before sending them to the testers. The integrations with 3rd party tools make it more useful. It provides a full development environment that looks very close to the real thing.Before we started using LambdaTest, we're limited to the browsers and their versions that are available on our desktops and laptops. But now with LambdaTest, we are using Selenium grid of 2000+ browsers and their versions available on the platform.If you want a solution to replace testing infrastructure that is hard to main and look after, LambdaTest is the best solution according to us.; Have been using Lambdatest for around 1 year now, and could say that it’s a useful testing tool for our team. Offering great combinations of browsers and operating systems for you to test on and most importantly there are many types of additional logs that come with each test which helps in debugging.. Glad to see the integration with Travis CI due to which we could optimally use this tool with our CI CD pipelines directly. We were able to effectively run TestNG and Selenium tests using their documentation and as an added advantage their support team is quick and helpful.; The industry we function (e-commerce) has a broad category of audience. We need to make sure our website is accessible to everyone irrespective of the browser / operating system they use. Ofcourse, responsive web design check is a major bullet point over our testing checklist as well. As a B2C, it's crucial for us to stay ahead of the customers and we wanted a solution which could help us ensure our changes would work seamlessly when shipped to the Production. LambdaTest made a great fit here when considered the latest browsers on the product, ability to test local pages along with a complimentary access to LT browser which is an absolute delight for our developers and testers. It helps us save a considerable effort on responsive testing plus the native developer tools allow us to dig deep into any UI mismatch! Also As mentioned we could achieve wider test coverage in time by running multiple combinations of browsers in parallel with LambdaTest automation suite. Our director to purchase the subscription was due to their affordable pricing for the parallel tests and the communication from the support team!; Running tests serially can be a good option when your product is at an early stage. But as we scaled the product, we needed a tool to reduce test time execution and pace up our test cycles. LambdaTest simplified the Selenium testing experience for us with their cloud based platform which allowed us to execute our test cases in parallel on hundreds of browsers. We could easily automate the test cases, get the sessions recorded and share the test reports across the team for assessment using Asana integration. We even leverage the integration with CircleCI to run automated tests on LambdaTest through our pipeline. The CircleCI Orb is handy for testing our privately hosted application.It’s good to see now that using LambdaTest we could run multiple tests on multiple VM’s, saving us hours of testing time and maintenance cost of local infrastructure. Personally, one thing that LambdaTest does very well is continuing to provide tutorials for testing, so that we stay up to speed and are even able to learn new things.I definitely saw myself applying a lot of the new concepts that I learned from their blogs.; As technology advances, enterprises are switching from manual testing to Selenium Test Automation. But one area most enterprises are still struggling is with the scalability of running several tests in parallel. LambdaTest has been a boon for us when it comes to Selenium automation. With a Selenium Grid based on the cloud, we don't need to stress about setting up and maintaining infrastructure anymore. We can run hundreds of tests in parallel on 2000+ browsers and OS versions running on real machines. LambdaTest really helped us in reducing our web testing cost and at the same time scale it as and when required.To leverage on marketing campaigns, we needed to ensure all our deliverables render seamlessly on different mobile and desktop browsers our users use to view them from across the world. The geolocation testing functionality helped us set the location and test our website over various locations. At LambdaTest, we can now run geolocation testing to test our website across 40+ countries. The pricing plan is pretty simple and easy to grasp, with no hidden costs at all.; We needed a testing tool that was scalable enough to cover all the browsers and OS as per our clients requirement and at the same time integrate well into our workflow. Lambdatest provided us with the necessary features to meet our browser compatibility testing requirements. Without any hassle of configuring, installing or maintaining the virtual machines, we are able to launch local browser tests instantly. The best part is, Lambdatest also helps us run our Selenium based automated tests on its cloud infra - that too without burning a hole in our pocket. They offer extensive mobile and desktop browsers, thereby increasing our test coverage to maximum.; We serve a variety of clients across industries, thus we need to make sure our website is accessible from every desktop, mobile browser combination they use. Responsive web design is an integral part of our testing process. As a B2B, you want to make sure that your services are always a step ahead of your customers. And to achieve that, it's important to have a tool that keeps your code and web designing process in sync with the Production.LambdaTest's variety of browsers and local testing capabilities made it a perfect fit for our requirements. Additionally we got free access to LT Browser which is absolutely loved by our developers. We are now in a better position while tackling misbehaving websites with the help of it’s inbuilt dev tools. The best part is that LambdaTest offers an automated parallel testing that helped us achieve faster and wider test coverage over multiple browsers. Its affordable price and fast technical support made the purchase decision very easy for the team. And yes I absolutely love their support staff. They are truly available for 24*7.; While we develop our web applications, our top concern was to verify the unintentional changes to the application's visuals. We need to make sure that changing one component doesn't break the styling of another component. LambdaTest's Smart testing helped us to identify visual regression bugs for every new build. We could capture our website screenshots belonging to different environments i.e stage and production & upload them on the LambdaTest Visual Testing platform. We were able to discover visual deviations with pixel to pixel comparison by capturing screenshots, comparing them against the baseline image, and highlighting visual changes. The slider mode is very helpful to compare the visual discrepancies between the two images by toggling them. Overall, Smart testing helped us perform reliable visual testing at scale and eliminated the risk of delivering visual bugs."
Serverspace,cloud-computing-companies,"
< $25/hr ",2019,"First of all I would like to thank Serverspace for this great platform! Out of other VPS services, this is my favorite, it offers me the flexibility to enhance my skills as a Full-Stack Developer as well as a server administrator. Well out of frustrations from other VPS services, since they have a lot of hassle to work on, this platform enabled me to easily pick my choice, add new memory capability just by a few clicks. I observed the great UI/UX of this platform, and I am planning to use this forever until this platform is still working.; I tried many cloud server providers like AWS, Azure, Google cloud and more but they didn't satisfy my needs but when I tried Serverspace I was shocked because of their server prices, for a startup that will be the best option, I saw that the price is low but the service is best as expensive, I am fully satisfied with this. I recommend Serverspace for startups once a time you see, a cybercriminal attacked my server in serverspace but... the company has reported me on time, so I saved my server from further attacks, Serverspace saved a lot of time and money.; What I like about this company is the many options offered to us customers since I'm a Windows/Linux User and most of my needs rely on multi-OS systems. That's why I run 4 servers with ServerSpace. Their Windows Machines are as good as you can imagine, they offer all the alternatives I need, and I also run servers with CentOS. With Serverspace, I can cover all my needs for my business, and the best part is I also have different options on the payment side. They only charge me for the current use and not a whole monthly amount in advance, and I can cancel any server I ordered at any second. Also, their support tickets get answered right away. It's pretty good. What I think they could do better is improve their automatic system detecting payments with Ever. Every time I pay with Ever, I have to send a support ticket with transaction ID and all info about the payment to add funds. I get a reply the same day, but I'd rather not have to notify it. I'm very happy with this service, and I'll; I tried six to seven cloud services before I settled with Serverspace. I am glad that I found it. All I need was a reliable, scalable, economical, and user-friendly server for my data crunching and web application. First, their pricing is way attractive. The bigger sites may start with some low teaser rates or even free credits, but their prices go up exponentially with more CPU and memory. Serverspace's pricing remains very reasonable. Granted they don't offer super big servers, I don't need them either. The other thing I like is that they charge significantly less when you turn off the server while other sites charge you the same. I like their simple offers; simple servers that let me build my own environments. The plethora of bells and whistles elsewhere turn me off. Their servers are generally reliable except they failed to turn on a couple of times. But they fixed it promptly and were responsive through the process. Their clean and intuitive web UI is helpful.; I work most of the time but I also trade forex to make some extra money. Since I am not always at home, I had to get an expert advisor for my trades and that was when I started looking for a reliable VPS service. I have been using Serverspace VPS for less than a year now and I can say it has been a peaceful experience in the sense that I never had to worry about shutting down of the server. It's very pocket-friendly and I like that I can pay daily as I use it. What I enjoy most is the option to shutdown a server without deleting or destroying it completely, that way I can restart the server when I need it and continue using it. Like I said, you only get charged for what you use. For a little fee, you also have the option to increase the size or speed of a VPS server if your work becomes bigger without having to get a new server. I can only hope to get more than 50 Mbps speed for the fixed plan as it takes more time to work when everything is so slow.; I have been using Serverspace for about 6 months now. System performance is good. I have never used a VPS before, so I need some help getting up and running. Support always answers back thru a support ticket, although you may have to wait up to 6 hours sometimes, the support is good. Their pricing has been great, and I plan to stay with the service.; Before I decided to use their servers to host our services, I checked out and tried many alternatives. Some time ago I found Serverspace at some offers comparer and I decided to give it a try and I'm really satisfied. There are no problems with servers which I met using servers from others. So at the moment, I think I will use Serverspace servers for my other projects and initiatives.; I like Serverspace! The relation between the purchase price and the performance is perfect. I like dealing with you because of the cheap prices and high performance. Also, the support team is fast, I always get my tickets resolved as fast as possible. The deployment of services is also fast. In general, I do have a good experience and would like to build a long-term relationship.; The uptime and the speed of the service are fantastic. The quality of support is second to none. Every time I need help, I get a very personalized answer and they always go the extra mile to solve my problem. I have tried many competitors in the past but none of them come close to the quality of service I am getting in Serverspace."

The final project was delivered and implemented without major complications.

AllianceTek,cloud-computing-companies,"
$25 - $49/hr ",2004,"We are a startup fintech company and needed to develop a mobile app in iOS and Android. The app is a social media platform for investing with back end analytics similar to Twitter. The development required integration with a high end data provider and a separate charting platform. After interviewing multiple (8) companies, I selected Alliancetek because they were experienced, offered end to end solutions beyond a standard mobile app firm, and their price point was below competing firms.Alliancetek delivered on all promises with great professionalism. We had to pivot several times in the course of the project and each hurdle was handled without a hitch. My “team” consisted of 3 Alliancetek employees (1 project manager, 1 iOS developer, 1 Android developer) who I spoke with weekly through Microsoft Team meetings. There were additional back end developers who worked on the project. I had an outstanding experience and give Alliancetek my highest recommendation.; My company was close to the launch date for a software platform that allows aspiring US college athletes to get recruited. It was a complex system involving many different elements, user types and features. With our primary in-house developer, we were running very late on our development schedule. We had a few months left to finish off the system before our customers began to use it. We brought AllianceTek on and they helped us get over the line with their amazing, responsive and high quality work. Without their tremendous work, we would not have been able to get over the line and give our customers a product that would be helpful to them. AllianceTek were honestly a game changer, and I could not imagine being where we are today as a company without their heavy and continued involvement.; The project has moved extremely smooth. The communication, the Dev team, I mean all of you guys over at Alliance Tech have just blown away my expectations and I can't thank you guys enough for helping me bring this idea into a reality. This is going to, not just revolutionise the industry, but revolutionise sales training in general. it's going to be able to present different scenarios, to the training platform getting feedback and uploading their videos to train to where we can train hundreds of people at the same time. I mean guys, this software that you guys have helped bring to life is truly going to change the industry.; Sokolis Group has been working with AllianceTek for almost a decade. We partnered with them to design and build a proprietary application that is critical to our business for analyzing and reporting our clients' fuel transaction data. Over the years, we have continued to work with AllianceTek to develop new features which helped make our business more efficient and our reporting to clients more insightful. In addition, AllianceTek provides the hosting and maintenance for this cloud-based application and we trust them to handle this important responsibility. They are a valued partner to our business and I would not hesitate to recommend them.; I work for a boutique leadership and communication consulting firm. As part of our service offerings, we provide clients a private and secure performance / developmental review site where employees are able to provide one another feedback on a regular cadence. We initially used an internal site, but as the scale of our projects and clients began to increase, we knew we needed to increase the sophistication of our site. That's where AllianceTek came in. Working together hand-in-hand, we developed a site tailored to the needs of our clients. Since development of the site, we've had clients ask for increased personalization and customization, and AllianceTek has been able to help us develop these in an expedient and efficient manner. Another bonus is that even after several years of working together, we've had the same points of contact throughout. This has been an invaluable part of us working together so well. After the past few years of working together, I couldn't recommend AllianceTek highly enough.; ; AllianceTek has delivered outstanding products and services which has helped Strategas achieve outstanding recognition from our financial services clients. Beyond those technical achievements, what sets this team apart from the crowd is the rapid responsiveness to my requests, be it a production problem, coding change, or business challenge; that kind of responsiveness is an exceptional work ethic not frequently seen in our industry and highly valued by my firm. I can always count upon this team to respond in kind with their best efforts.; ; "
